/**
 * Generate .claude-plugin/plugin.json from catalog/agents.json.
 *
 * The Claude Code plugin spec lets a manifest declare its agents via an
 * explicit array of file paths (see code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference,
 * field `agents`). The repo's agents live at
 *   agents/<provider>/<agent>/harnesses/claude-code.agent.md
 * which is one nesting level deeper than the conventional flat
 *   agents/<agent>.md
 * Rather than restructuring the catalog (which would break the multi-harness
 * design and the npm package layout), this script enumerates every
 * claude-code adapter file and writes it into plugin.json's `agents` array.
 *
 * Output is sorted and deterministic so the manifest is reproducible across
 * runs and reviewable in change set.
 *
 * Mode:
 *   --check  exit 1 if the on-disk manifest does not match the generated one
 *   (default) overwrite the on-disk manifest
