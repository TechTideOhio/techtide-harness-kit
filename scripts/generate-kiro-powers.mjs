/**
 * Generate Kiro Powers from catalog/agents.json.
 *
 * Each Power is a directory under powers/ containing a single POWER.md.
 * Kiro Powers spec (kirodotdev/powers) restricts frontmatter to exactly
 * five fields: name, displayName, description, keywords, author. No
 * version, no repository, no license, no tags. The validator enforces
 * the strict-5 rule.
 *
 * Body content is templated from per-provider config (steering content
 * authored once, here) plus catalog facts (maestro id, live-guard list,
 * agent count) read at generate time. This keeps the steering tight
 * and the agent inventory accurate.
 *
 * Mode:
 *   --check  exit 1 if any on-disk Power does not match the generated one
 *   (default) write/overwrite all Powers
