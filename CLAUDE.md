# TechTide Harness Kit

This repository is a curated marketplace for **cloud**, **zero-trust**, and **compliance-aware** AI workflows.

## What this repo contains

- `skills/` - reusable workflows for recurring engineering tasks
- `agents/` - expert roles with judgment for review, architecture, and operations
- `rules/` - harness-specific operating guidance
- `mcp/` - MCP references and trust-boundary notes
- `catalog/` - machine-readable indexes
- `schemas/` - metadata contracts
- `docs/` - governance, taxonomy, compatibility, and quality guidance

## Operating stance

- Prefer **official docs** and **live evidence** over memory.
- Default to **least privilege**, **zero trust**, and **safe rollback paths**.
- Separate **verified facts**, **judgment**, **assumptions**, and **unknowns**.
- Treat broad permissions, destructive automation, and MCP mutation paths as high risk.
- Do not add secrets, credentials, tokens, tenant IDs, or customer data.

## When working in this repo

- Keep changes scoped and traceable to the task.
- Update catalog metadata when adding, moving, or removing cataloged assets.
- Run `npm run validate` before finishing. The pipeline runs seven gates:
  `validate:catalog`, `validate:aws`, `manifest:check`,
  `validate:allowed-tools`, `validate:skill-schema`, `validate:agent-schema`,
  `validate:links`. Markdownlint and codespell run separately as the
  `Docs Quality` workflow (advisory `npm run lint:docs`).
- If `skills/**` changed intentionally, also refresh
  `catalog/skill-manifest.json` with `npm run manifest:write`.
- Every `SKILL.md` must declare an `allowed-tools` field
  (least-privilege baseline) and conform to
  `schemas/skill.frontmatter.schema.json`.
- For agents that have a 1:1 companion skill, declare it explicitly via
  `companion_skills: [<skill-id>]` in the agent's `metadata.json` rather
  than relying on the name-stripping convention.

## Cross-platform asset rule

This repo supports multiple harnesses without pretending they are identical.

- Keep portable logic in canonical specs and shared docs.
- Keep harness-specific behavior in the right adapter format.
- Do not invent unsupported metadata fields in executable agent files.
