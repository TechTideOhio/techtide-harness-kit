Nearest built-in roles: `Key Vault Crypto Officer` (for keys), `Key Vault Secrets Officer` (for secrets).
Both include delete - prefer the custom role above for rotation-only scenarios.

**Action vs DataAction distinction (security-critical)**:
`Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/purge/action` is a **control-plane Action** that purges the
soft-deleted **vault** itself (irreversible). It is **not** a DataAction and is not blocked
by `NotDataActions`. It must be in `NotActions`. Similarly, certificate purge/delete operations
exist as both control-plane and data-plane operations depending on the API path; this role
blocks both. Do not assume `NotDataActions` covers all destructive Key Vault paths - it does not.

## Purge-protection enablement (separate, highly privileged operation)

Requires: `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/write` on the vault resource.
Assign via PIM with justification and at most 1-hour activation window.

**IRREVERSIBILITY WARNING**: Once `enablePurgeProtection: true` is set on a vault,
it cannot be unset. All soft-deleted objects in that vault are protected from permanent deletion
until the soft-delete retention period (7-90 days) expires. This is a one-way door.

## Do not assign

- `Key Vault Administrator` standing (includes purge rights)
- `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/purge/action` to rotation operators
- `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies/write` to non-admins (legacy access policy model)
