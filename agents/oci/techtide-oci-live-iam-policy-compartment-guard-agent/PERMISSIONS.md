# Permissions: OCI Live IAM Policy Compartment Guard

# OCI IAM policy for IAM policy compartment guard

## Identity model preference

1. Named IAM-admin group scoped to an IAM-management compartment
2. Dual-approval for tenancy-root policy changes (separate writer and approver)
3. Never use `any-user` or `any-group` for policy management
4. Tenancy-root policy changes require separate security-team sign-off

## Verb hierarchy reference

```
inspect  = ListXxx APIs only. No resource content.
read     = GetXxx + inspect. Can see resource details.
use      = read + limited mutation (no create/terminate).
manage   = full CRUD. Always scope to compartment, never tenancy for broad resources.
```

## Audit-only policy

```
Allow group <iam-auditors> to inspect policies in tenancy
Allow group <iam-auditors> to read policies in tenancy
Allow group <iam-auditors> to inspect dynamic-groups in tenancy
Allow group <iam-auditors> to read dynamic-groups in tenancy
Allow group <iam-auditors> to inspect groups in tenancy
Allow group <iam-auditors> to read users in tenancy
```

## Policy operator (compartment-scoped write, never tenancy root)

```
Allow group <iam-operators> to manage policies in compartment <iam-compartment>
  where target.policy.name = /iam-managed-*/
Allow group <iam-operators> to manage dynamic-groups in tenancy
  where target.dynamicGroup.name = /iam-managed-*/
```

`dynamic-groups` are tenancy-scoped in OCI - they cannot be compartment-scoped.
This is the minimum necessary `manage` at tenancy scope. The `where` name-pattern
condition restricts which dynamic groups this role can create or modify, preventing
privilege escalation through creation of an unrestricted dynamic group.

**Critical syntax note**: OCI IAM uses **forward-slash regex pattern syntax** `= /pattern*/`
for wildcard matching, **not** `= 'pattern-*'` (which is exact-string match for the
literal `pattern-*`). Quoted-string equality in a `where` clause is a no-op security
control if the operator can choose any name not matching the literal exact value.
See [Oracle policy conditions docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policysyntax/conditions.htm).

## Tag-condition for policy name pattern restriction

```
Allow group <iam-operators> to manage policies in compartment <iam-compartment>
  where target.policy.name = /iam-managed-*/
```

## Tenancy-root admin (third tier - break-glass only)

OCI policy-based IAM separates compartment-scoped operators from tenancy-root
admins. The tenancy-root admin is a **break-glass** identity activated only for
incidents that require touching tenancy-level policies (e.g., when an
operator-managed policy would create a cycle or escalation path).

```
Allow group <iam-tenancy-admins> to manage policies in tenancy
  where request.user.mfaTotpVerified = 'true'
Allow group <iam-tenancy-admins> to manage groups in tenancy
  where target.group.name != 'Administrators'
```

- MFA-TOTP gate enforced at policy-evaluation time (not just login).
- Cannot modify the `Administrators` group from this role - that requires the
  bootstrap tenancy admin (no automation, no service principal).
- Membership in `<iam-tenancy-admins>` should be empty by default; add only for
  the duration of an approved change window, then remove.

## Do not use

```
# FORBIDDEN
Allow any-group to manage policies in tenancy
Allow group <iam-operators> to manage policies in tenancy
Allow any-user to inspect all-resources in tenancy
```
