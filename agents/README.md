## Agent tiers

All provider portfolios follow the same three-tier model:

### Advisory agents (read-only by default)

Use for review, diagnosis, planning, briefing, triage, and non-destructive coordination. These never write to live cloud environments.

### Execution agents (workspace-write)

Workspace-write in Codex but still non-destructive toward live cloud by default. Used for patching repo files - manifests, IaC, CI/CD configs, rollout definitions.

| Agent | Provider | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `techtide-aws-deployment-hotfix-operator-agent` | AWS | rapid repo-side deployment corrections |
| `techtide-aws-iac-patch-executor-agent` | AWS | bounded IaC patching |
| `techtide-aws-pipeline-fix-operator-agent` | AWS | CI/CD config fixes |
| `techtide-aws-serverless-rollout-corrector-agent` | AWS | serverless rollout file corrections |
| `techtide-aws-ecs-service-remediation-operator-agent` | AWS | ECS/Fargate config remediation |

### Guarded live operators

Workspace-write in Codex, but designed for repos or shells connected to real cloud credentials or deployment authority. They must confirm target identity, require explicit approval, prefer preview or dry-run evidence, and define rollback plus post-change verification before mutation.
