Google Cloud Platform agent catalog for this marketplace. 😄

## 🧱 Agent tiers

| Tier | Purpose | Default access | Live GCP mutation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role / advisory agents | Review, design, diagnose, coordinate | read-only | not allowed by default |
| Guarded live operators | Work in repos or shells that may target real GCP environments | workspace-write | approval-gated and target-confirmed only |

## 🚦 Guarded live-GCP operators

| Agent | Primary use | Default live posture | Must refuse when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `techtide-gcp-live-gke-rollout-guard-agent` | live GKE deployment and node pool mutations | PDB audit + health evidence + rollback required | rollout safety signals are weak or cluster control-plane change is unreviewed |
| `techtide-gcp-live-iam-policy-change-guard-agent` | live IAM binding mutations and org policy changes | current bindings snapshot + blast-radius review + approval required | SA key creation or org-level policy change lacks dual approval |
| `techtide-gcp-live-kms-key-destruction-guard-agent` | Cloud KMS key version destruction and key ring deletion | rotation-vs-destruction separation + CMEK usage audit + waiting period | key is in active CMEK use and destruction has no scheduled waiting period |
| `techtide-gcp-live-cost-budget-action-guard-agent` | live budget threshold mutations and CUD commitments | budget baseline + alert thresholds + quota read-only | budget action would remove cost alerts or CUD commitment lacks approval |
| `techtide-gcp-live-bigquery-dataset-deletion-guard-agent` | BigQuery dataset deletion and table truncation | full table inventory + authorized view audit + retention check | dataset contains billable partitions or authorized views with active downstream consumers |
| `techtide-gcp-live-cloud-run-traffic-migration-guard-agent` | Cloud Run revision traffic percentage changes | revision health + min-instances review + rollback percentage plan | traffic shift requested without health checks or rollback revision confirmed |

| `techtide-gcp-ticket-triage-escalation-coordinator-agent` | P0/P1/P2/P3 triage, Google Cloud support SLA enforcement, evidence collection |
| `techtide-gcp-support-incident-coordinator-agent` | severity mapping, TAM escalation, evidence scrubbing, PIR rights |
| `techtide-gcp-daily-operations-briefing-coordinator-agent` | billing delta, Cloud Monitoring alert owners, GKE health, quota warnings |

## 🛡️ Operating note

- 😄 advisory agents stay read-only by default
- 🚦 guarded live operators must confirm project ID, region, IAM principal, approval, rollback, and verification before mutation
- ⚠️ VPC is global in GCP - network mutations can affect all regions; the guard always confirms scope before any routing or firewall change
- 🔑 Service Accounts are resources, not just identities - key creation has org-wide blast radius; `techtide-gcp-live-iam-policy-change-guard-agent` treats SA key creation as a live-guard action
- 🧾 all live-guard agents produce a structured verdict response - see [`docs/evidence-output-spec.md`](../../docs/evidence-output-spec.md)
