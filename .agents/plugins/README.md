# `.agents/plugins/` - OpenAI Codex CLI marketplace registry

This directory holds the **OpenAI Codex CLI** plugin marketplace registry
for `techtide-harness-kit`. Codex looks for marketplace JSON at this
canonical path when you run `codex plugin marketplace add owner/repo`.

## What's in here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`marketplace.json`](marketplace.json) | Declares this repo as a Codex marketplace. Lists two plugins: `techtide-harness-kit` (main) and `techtide-cross-platform-agent-template` (scaffold). Hand-maintained. |

## How users install

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add TechTideOhio/techtide-harness-kit
/plugin install techtide-harness-kit@techtide-harness-kit
```

After `codex plugin marketplace add`, Codex writes the following into
`~/.codex/config.toml` (this is the local user config - not in this repo):

```toml
[marketplaces.techtide-harness-kit]
last_updated = "2026-05-11T06:46:00Z"
last_revision = "<sha>"
source_type = "git"
source = "https://github.com/TechTideOhio/techtide-harness-kit.git"

[plugins."techtide-harness-kit@techtide-harness-kit"]
enabled = true
```

Other commands:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade techtide-harness-kit
codex plugin marketplace remove techtide-harness-kit
```

## How to update

This file is hand-maintained because Codex marketplaces are small. Required
fields per Codex spec on every plugin entry: `policy.installation`,
`policy.authentication`, `category`. The validator
(`validate:codex-marketplace`) enforces:

- `name` is `techtide-harness-kit`
- every plugin has kebab-case `name`
- plugin folder name **equals** plugin name (Codex strict rule)
- `source.source` is `"local"` and `source.path` resolves to a real directory
- every referenced plugin has `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `policy.{installation, authentication}` and `category` are present
- main plugin's `version` matches `package.json` `version`

```bash
npm run validate:codex-marketplace
```

## Design notes

- **Canonical path** - Codex docs are explicit: repo plugin marketplaces live
  at `<repo-root>/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Earlier in this PR's
  history I mistakenly deleted this file thinking it was a precursor to the
  Claude Code marketplace; the official docs corrected that and the file is
  now back at its canonical location.
- **Two plugins, not one** - `techtide-harness-kit` is the main entry
  point for cloud/security/compliance work. `techtide-cross-platform-agent-template`
  is a scaffold for authors who want to build new cross-platform agents
  using this repo's adapter pattern.
- **Codex plugins bundle skills/hooks/MCP servers, not agents** - Codex
  agents are loaded from `.codex/agents/*.toml` at the workspace or user
  level, not from plugin manifests. The plugin's role is to bootstrap the
  marketplace presence; agent adapter files are still written via
  `npx thk-export-agents --platform codex --all --repo .`. This two-step
  model is documented in the README's Codex install dropdown.
