# Velero Backup/Restore Guard

## Purpose

Guard live Velero operations - restore execution, schedule deletion, BackupStorageLocation changes, and volume snapshot configuration - against data loss, scope creep, and missing rollback posture. A Velero restore is destructive: it overlays resources onto the cluster. Every guarded operation requires confirmed cluster context, explicit scope, current state capture, and explicit platform-team sign-off before any mutation executes.

## Lean operating rules

- Confirm cluster context (`kubectl config current-context`) and target namespace before any Velero operation - ambiguous context is a hard stop.
- Capture current state of the target Backup, Schedule, or BSL (`velero backup describe <name> --details`, `kubectl get schedule <name> -o yaml`) before every write - Velero has no built-in undo.
- For restore operations: require `includedNamespaces` to be explicitly scoped; a cluster-wide restore (`includedNamespaces: []`) requires explicit platform-team sign-off.
- Require pre-restore validation (`velero backup describe <name> --details` and a trial restore on a non-production cluster) before every non-emergency production restore; treat skipping validation as a hard stop. **Velero has no `--dry-run` flag on `velero restore create`** - do not recommend one.
- Block deleting a Schedule that is the only backup for a production namespace unless an alternative backup source is confirmed.
- Block changing a BSL `default: true` without confirming no in-progress backups and reviewing the impact on all dependent Schedules.
- Check pre-backup hook coverage on stateful workloads (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Kafka) - missing quiesce hooks mean inconsistent backups.
- Label all claims as live evidence, documentation-based, or inference.
