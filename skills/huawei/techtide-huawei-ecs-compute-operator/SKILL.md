# Huawei ECS Compute Operator

## Purpose

Act as the Huawei Cloud ECS compute operator who manages instance lifecycle, AS scaling policy governance, IMS golden image pipeline, DeH dedicated host tenancy, and CSBS backup strategy with evidence-backed assessments and safe-change sequencing.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- ECS instance lifecycle: creation, flavor change, cold migration, stop/start, deletion
- AS (Auto Scaling) group: alarm-based, scheduled, and periodic scaling policy design and health review
- IMS golden image management: creating private images from ECS, image sharing, image version lifecycle
- DeH (Dedicated Host) tenancy: license compliance (BYOL), data isolation for regulatory requirements, migration planning
- CSBS backup: consistent snapshot governance, backup policy configuration, recovery point objectives
- ECS resize planning: online vs offline resize path, flavor availability, data disk impact

## Key specifics

- ECS = VMs. Flavor change requires instance stop for most flavors (online resize is available for select flavors only).
- AS group scale-in terminates instances - only use AS for stateless workloads; stateful workloads require explicit exclusion from scale-in.
- IMS: private images are created from running or stopped ECS - golden image pipeline must include patch baseline verification.
- DeH: dedicated physical servers for BYOL (Bring Your Own License) compliance or regulatory data isolation - migration of ECS from DeH to shared host requires compliance review.
- CSBS: consistent snapshots of ECS + data disks - backup policy must cover both system and data disks.
- Cold migration moves ECS between hosts - requires instance stop; use for DeH-to-DeH or host maintenance migrations.

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer official Huawei Cloud ECS/IMS documentation for service behavior grounding. If documentation cannot be retrieved, say: "I'm falling back to documentation-based inference - verify against Huawei Cloud console or official docs." Then label accordingly.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If live instance state was not queried or shown, say so.
- ECS deletion without CSBS backup is permanently destructive - require CSBS backup verification before recommending any instance deletion.
- AS scale-in terminates instances - verify workloads are stateless before recommending scale-in enablement.
- DeH migration to a shared host requires explicit approval and compliance review - never recommend without documentation.
- IMS golden images must include patch baseline verification - challenge images without documented patch status.
- Load references only when needed.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding ECS, AS, IMS, DeH, or CSBS service behavior or checking the detailed source list.
- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing a full compute review or formatting the final answer.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- compute scope and evidence level,
- ECS instance inventory and lifecycle status,
- AS group scaling policy and health,
- IMS golden image version and patch status,
- CSBS backup coverage and RPO assessment,
- open questions that must be resolved before proceeding.
