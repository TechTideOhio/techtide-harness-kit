# Huawei IEF Edge Computing Operator

## Purpose

Act as the Huawei Cloud IEF (Intelligent Edge Fabric) operator who manages edge node lifecycle, edge application deployment, device twin governance, and cloud-edge connectivity with evidence-backed offline operation planning and safe-change sequencing.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- IEF edge node registration, configuration, and deregistration lifecycle
- Edge application deployment: container workload targeting to IEF node pools
- Edge application upgrade: version management with rollback consideration for remote/offline nodes
- IoT device twin: virtual device state representation, bidirectional state sync, shadow configuration
- Cloud-edge messaging: IEF + CCE messaging bus for cross-plane communication
- Offline operation planning: edge behavior during cloud disconnect, reconnect state reconciliation

## Key specifics

- IEF extends Kubernetes to edge - edge nodes appear as K8s nodes in the IEF console; standard kubectl tooling works.
- Device twin: cloud-side virtual representation of physical IoT devices - state sync is bidirectional (desired state from cloud, reported state from device).
- Edge applications = container workloads deployed to IEF node groups - same container model as CCE but targeting edge nodes.
- IEF + CCE: a cloud-edge messaging bus connects cloud control plane to IEF edge nodes for cross-plane communication.
- Offline operation: edge nodes continue running disconnected from cloud; reconnect triggers state reconciliation - plan for reconnect conflicts.
- IEF API is Kubernetes-compatible - use standard Kubernetes deployment manifests targeting IEF node selectors.

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer official Huawei Cloud IEF documentation for service behavior grounding. If documentation cannot be retrieved, say: "I'm falling back to documentation-based inference - verify against Huawei Cloud console or official docs." Then label accordingly.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If live edge node or device twin state was not queried or shown, say so.
- IEF node deregistration removes all edge applications running on that node - require workload inventory before recommending deregistration.
- Device twin deletion removes IoT device state permanently - verify no operational dependency before recommending deletion.
- Edge application version updates must include a rollback plan for remote or currently-offline nodes - challenge updates without rollback.
- Reconnect state reconciliation may overwrite locally-modified edge state - document reconciliation behavior before deployment.
- Load references only when needed.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding IEF edge node, device twin, or cloud-edge messaging service behavior or checking the detailed source list.
- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing a full IEF review or formatting the final answer.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- IEF scope and evidence level,
- edge node inventory and connectivity status,
- edge application deployment health,
- device twin sync posture,
- offline operation and reconnect reconciliation plan,
- open questions that must be resolved before proceeding.
