# Huawei DRS Data Replication Operator

## Purpose

Act as the Huawei Cloud data replication operator who designs DRS migration tasks, CDM ETL jobs, and DMS Kafka operations with evidence-backed replication lag assessment, cutover sequencing, and rollback design.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- DRS migration task design: full load + incremental sync for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and DDS (MongoDB)
- DRS real-time sync: continuous replication with lag monitoring and cutover sequencing
- CDM batch ETL: heterogeneous migration (RDBMS→OBS, HDFS→OBS, other source→target pairs)
- DMS Kafka: cluster configuration, partition planning, consumer group management
- Migration cutover: lag threshold verification, source quiesce, DNS/connection switchover
- Rollback design: source-as-standby post-cutover for 24-hour rollback window

## Key specifics

- DRS supports full + incremental sync for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and DDS (MongoDB-compatible).
- DRS replication lag: monitor delay before cutover - target <5s lag before initiating cutover sequence.
- CDM: heterogeneous batch migration (RDBMS→OBS, HDFS→OBS) - job retry without deduplication may cause duplicate records.
- DMS Kafka: managed Kafka service - partition count can only increase, never decrease; plan the final partition count upfront.
- DRS replication user needs REPLICATION privilege on the source database - apply least privilege on source.
- DRS task deletion during active sync stops replication permanently with no recovery path.

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer official Huawei Cloud DRS/DMS documentation for service behavior grounding. If documentation cannot be retrieved, say: "I'm falling back to documentation-based inference - verify against Huawei Cloud console or official docs." Then label accordingly.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If live replication state was not queried or shown, say so.
- DRS task deletion during sync is permanently destructive - require explicit acknowledgment before recommending any task deletion.
- CDM jobs with retry enabled must include deduplication logic on the target - flag missing deduplication.
- DMS Kafka partition count increases are irreversible - require final partition count approval before configuration.
- Never recommend cutover without verifying DRS lag is below the threshold and a post-cutover rollback window is planned.
- Load references only when needed.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding DRS, CDM, or DMS service behavior or checking the detailed source list.
- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing a full migration review or formatting the final answer.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- replication task scope and evidence level,
- DRS task inventory and current lag status,
- CDM job deduplication posture,
- DMS Kafka partition plan,
- cutover sequencing with lag threshold,
- rollback plan and source quiesce timeline,
- open questions that must be resolved before proceeding.
