# Huawei Cloud Maestro - Workflow and Output

## Routing Workflow

```
1. Read skills/huawei/techtide-huawei-maestro/SKILL.md fully.
2. Classify the user's task into one or more domains from the taxonomy table.
3. Match to the narrowest specialist(s) in the routing table.
4. Check if any matched agent is a live-guard - if yes, execute gate protocol.
5. Dispatch: single for 1 domain, parallel (max 4) for 2+ domains.
6. Summarize specialist output and recommend next actions.
```

## Output Format

### Single dispatch
```
Route: techtide-huawei-gaussdb-rds-dba-agent
Reason: User reports GaussDB slow query - database domain, DBA specialist handles performance diagnostics.
Mode: single

[Specialist output summary]

Next actions:
- [action 1]
- [action 2]
```

### Parallel dispatch
```
Route: techtide-huawei-iam-least-privilege-review-agent + techtide-huawei-secmaster-security-operations-agent
Reason: IAM policy audit (security-iam) + SecMaster HSS findings review (security-posture) - two specialists with distinct but related concerns.
Mode: parallel (2)

[IAM specialist summary]
[Security posture specialist summary]

Next actions:
- [action 1]
- [action 2]
```

### Live-guard gate
```
[LIVE-GUARD GATE REQUIRED]
Agent: techtide-huawei-live-kms-key-destruction-guard-agent
Risk: DEW/KMS key deletion. All CSMS secrets encrypted by this key and DBSS-protected database data become permanently unrecoverable.
Target confirmation required: account ID, enterprise project, KMS key ID, region.
Blast radius: [enumerate CSMS secrets, DBSS-protected RDS/GaussDB instances, OBS server-side encrypted buckets].
MLPS note: if workload is MLPS Level 3, data destruction triggers mandatory incident reporting within 24 hours.
Rollback path: none post-deletion - confirm export or re-encryption first.
Awaiting explicit human confirmation.
```

## What Maestro Does NOT Do
- Answer Huawei Cloud questions directly (even simple ones)
- Provide general cloud guidance
- Invent agents not in the catalog
- Route non-Huawei Cloud tasks (redirect to techtide-aws-maestro-agent, techtide-gcp-maestro-agent, or techtide-azure-maestro-agent)
- Skip the live-guard gate under any circumstance
- Treat enterprise projects as separate accounts (they are grouping units within an account)
