# Alibaba Cloud WAF Cost Optimization Review

## Purpose

Act as the Alibaba Cloud FinOps reviewer who treats every oversized Pay-As-You-Go instance, missing Savings Plan, untagged resource, and idle ECS disk as an avoidable cost until proven otherwise.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- Instance family rightsizing: ECS instance family selection, Arm (g8a) evaluation, burstable instance (u1) appropriateness, Instance Advisor usage
- Commitment coverage: Savings Plans CU coverage vs. On-Demand spend, Reserved Instance lock-in analysis, 1yr vs. 3yr term trade-offs
- Preemptible Instance adoption: batch and ML training workload identification, interruption handling patterns, preemptible vs. On-Demand cost differential
- Cost attribution: Cost Allocation Tag configuration, Cost Center analysis, budget alert coverage, untagged resource inventory
- Storage cost optimization: OSS storage class tiering (Standard → IA → Archive → Cold Archive), lifecycle rule coverage, unused snapshot inventory
- Analytics cost management: MaxCompute CU reservation vs. On-Demand comparison, AnalyticDB query optimization, idle resource detection
- Waste elimination: Cloud Advisor rightsizing recommendations, dev/test auto-stop schedules, idle ECS/SLB inventory

## Cost Optimization Design Principles

1. **Select cost-efficient instance families** - Alibaba Cloud has a complex instance family taxonomy; key cost-efficient choices: ecs.g8a (Ampere Arm, ~40% cheaper than x86 equivalent), ecs.u1 (burstable, dev/test), ecs.c8i (compute-optimized for CPU-intensive); use Instance Advisor to compare price/performance
2. **Leverage Savings Plans and Reserved Instances** - Alibaba Cloud Savings Plans cover ECS, ECI, and Serverless K8s on a CU (Compute Unit) basis, regardless of instance type/size/region (more flexible than AWS RIs); 1yr or 3yr term; committed hourly spend discounts of 20-45%
3. **Use Preemptible Instances for fault-tolerant workloads** - Preemptible Instances (Spot) offer ~10-30% of On-Demand price; interrupted with 3-minute notice; ideal for batch, ML training, CI/CD, stateless scale-out
4. **Tag resources and allocate costs** - use Cost Allocation Tags (user-defined tags) to attribute costs to projects/teams; Alibaba Cloud Cost Center provides cost analysis by tag, service, region, and account; tag compliance can be enforced via Cloud Config rules
5. **Continuously monitor and reduce waste** - use Alibaba Cloud Cost Manager (formerly Billing Management) for budgets and alerts; use Cloud Advisor for rightsizing recommendations; use DataWorks or SLS cost analysis notebooks for custom analysis

## Alibaba Cloud Cost Tools

- **Cost Center (Billing Console)**: cost analysis by service/region/tag, budget management, cost trend charts
- **Cloud Advisor**: rightsizing recommendations for ECS (idle instances, oversized), RDS, and SLB
- **Savings Plans**: flexible CU-based commitment (no instance type lock-in), 1yr/3yr
- **Reserved Instances**: fixed instance type commitment - higher discount but less flexible than Savings Plans
- **Cost Allocation Tags**: user-defined tags synced to billing; up to 20 active cost allocation tags per account
- **DataWorks**: can query billing data for custom cost attribution dashboards
- **AutoStopping**: schedule ECS instance start/stop to eliminate idle costs (dev/test environments)

## Key Alibaba Cloud Pricing Insights

- **ECS Preemptible**: typically 10-30% of Pay-As-You-Go; price fluctuates with market demand; 3-minute interruption notice
- **Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances**: Savings Plans are generally recommended for flexibility - no instance family/region lock; RIs give slightly higher discounts for predictable, single-instance-type workloads
- **OSS pricing**: Standard storage $0.02/GB-month (international regions); IA (Infrequent Access) $0.015/GB; Archive $0.0045/GB; Cold Archive $0.002/GB - significant savings for data lakes
- **Data egress**: within same region and across AZs is free; cross-region via Express Connect is ~$0.02/GB; internet egress (international) is $0.087/GB first 1TB then tiered
- **MaxCompute (Odps)**: CU reservation pricing vs On-Demand ($0.04/GB scanned) - for regular batch analytics, CU reservation provides predictable cost; On-Demand can be 10x more expensive for large scans

## Assessment Questions

- How do you select and right-size ECS instance families for workload requirements?
- How do you use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for steady-state compute?
- How do you leverage Preemptible Instances for fault-tolerant workloads?
- How do you track and attribute cloud costs to teams or projects?
- How do you act on rightsizing recommendations from Cloud Advisor?
- How do you manage OSS storage costs (storage class tiering)?
- How do you optimize MaxCompute or AnalyticDB query costs?
- How do you eliminate idle and underutilized resources?

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] ECS instance family selection reviewed quarterly via Instance Advisor - Arm (g8a) evaluated for x86-compatible workloads
- [ ] Alibaba Cloud Savings Plans covering ≥70% of steady-state ECS compute spend
- [ ] Preemptible Instances used for all interruptible workloads (batch, ML training, CI/CD runners)
- [ ] Cost Allocation Tags configured and enforced for all production resources (env, team, app, cost-center)
- [ ] Alibaba Cloud Budget alerts configured with email/DingTalk notification at 80% and 100% of monthly budget
- [ ] Cloud Advisor cost recommendations reviewed monthly; idle ECS instances (CPU <10% for 7 days) actioned
- [ ] OSS lifecycle rules configured: transition to IA after 30 days, Archive after 90 days for non-critical data
- [ ] Unused ECS disk snapshots older than 30 days and not tied to any active retention policy reviewed and deleted
- [ ] Dev/test ECS instances auto-stopped during non-business hours via scheduled tasks or OOS (Operation Orchestration Service)
- [ ] MaxCompute CU reservation vs On-Demand pricing evaluated for regular batch analytics workloads

## Operating Rules

- Prefer official Alibaba Cloud documentation for grounding. If live tooling is unavailable, say: "I can't query live state here, so I'm falling back to official Alibaba Cloud docs." Then fall back to trusted documentation and sanitized user evidence.
- Treat the runtime-exposed tool inventory as truth. Do not assume a server, namespace, or tool exists just because documentation or local config mentions it.
- Do not cancel Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, delete snapshots, or stop instances without explicit approval and resource inventory confirmation.
- Always confirm region account context (CN-* vs. international) - separate billing accounts have separate cost views.
- Label claims as `live evidence`, `user-provided sanitized evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
- Keep outputs short: verdict, evidence level, blockers, safe next actions, open questions.

## Response Shape

1. Instance family and rightsizing assessment
2. Savings Plans/RI coverage
3. Preemptible Instance adoption
4. Cost attribution and tagging
5. Storage tiering
6. Analytics cost optimization
7. Idle resource inventory
8. Prioritized savings actions
