# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing a full ACR governance audit, supply chain security review, or production-readiness assessment.

## Audit domains

Check these areas before giving a recommendation:

- ACR edition: Enterprise vs Personal, SLA coverage, rate limit exposure
- Namespace visibility: public vs private, IAM policy least privilege
- Vulnerability scanning: scanner configuration, severity thresholds, blocking policy
- Tag immutability: mutable vs immutable tag enforcement per repository
- Image retention: lifecycle policy, untagged image cleanup, storage cost management
- Cross-region replication: replication rules, target regions, replication lag monitoring
- Supply chain security: image signing, provenance attestation, SBOM availability
- China/international separation: CN-* vs international instance isolation

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame the audit scope**
   - ACR instance type (Enterprise/Personal) and region(s):
   - Production namespaces and repositories in scope:
   - Regulatory or compliance requirements:
   - Explicit out-of-scope items:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer live ACR console or API evidence if available.
   - Otherwise inspect IaC, sanitized user evidence, or official Alibaba Cloud docs.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `repo evidence`, `user-provided evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Stress-test the posture**
   - Are any production namespaces publicly accessible?
   - Are HIGH or CRITICAL CVEs present in production images?
   - Are mutable tags used in production deployments?
   - Is there a single region of failure for any production image?
   - What evidence is missing?
4. **Recommend the smallest safe hardening sequence**
   - Prioritize public namespace remediation above all other findings.
   - If the safest action is to gather more evidence, say that plainly.
