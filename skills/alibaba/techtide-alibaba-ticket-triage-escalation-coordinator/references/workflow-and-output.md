# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when executing the full incident triage workflow, escalation coordination, or post-incident review preparation.

## Triage domains

Check these areas before giving a recommendation:

- Incident scope: affected services, regions (CN-* vs international), user impact
- Alibaba Cloud status page: CN-* (status.aliyun.com) and international (status.alibabacloud.com)
- Severity classification: P0/P1/P2/P3 based on business impact and recovery time objective
- Evidence collection: CloudMonitor metrics, SLS log samples, RDS slow query logs, ActionTrail API call history
- Support ticket: severity mapping (紧急/高/中/低), account context, and correct console
- SLA tracking: response time deadline per priority and support tier
- DingTalk war room: required participants, update cadence, and communication template

## Safe workflow

1. **Classify the incident**
   - What services are affected and in which regions (CN-* vs international)?
   - What is the business impact (revenue loss, user count, SLA breach)?
   - Assign P0/P1/P2/P3 based on impact and recovery urgency.
2. **Check platform status**
   - Open status.aliyun.com (CN-*) and status.alibabacloud.com (international).
   - If a platform incident is active, reference it in the support ticket.
3. **Collect evidence in parallel with mitigation**
   - CloudMonitor: error rate, latency, CPU/memory spikes.
   - SLS: log error patterns, slow request samples (scrubbed of PII).
   - RDS: slow query log, connection pool exhaustion metrics.
   - ActionTrail: unusual API calls in the 30-minute window before incident.
4. **File support ticket with correct severity and account context**
   - CN-* workloads: file in Alibaba Cloud CN console.
   - International workloads: file in Alibaba Cloud International console.
   - Attach scrubbed evidence; never include credentials or raw PII.
5. **Track SLA and escalate**
   - Record ticket creation timestamp.
   - If Urgent (P0): escalate to account manager if no response in 2 hours.
   - If High (P1): escalate if no response in 4 hours.
