# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing a full network design, connectivity review, or production-readiness pass.

## Design domains

Check these areas before giving a recommendation:

- VPC CIDR planning, subnet segmentation, and availability zone distribution
- Security group rules and Network ACL baselines
- CEN transit router configuration and bandwidth package sizing
- Load balancer type selection and listener configuration
- Express Connect or Smart Access Gateway for private/branch connectivity
- Monitoring and flow log coverage

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame requirements**
   - Connectivity endpoints (regions, accounts, on-premises, branches):
   - Throughput, latency, and availability targets:
   - Compliance and data residency constraints:
   - Existing topology constraints:
   - Explicit non-goals:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer live VPC/CEN console or API evidence if available.
   - Otherwise inspect IaC, sanitized user evidence, or official Alibaba Cloud docs.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `repo evidence`, `user-provided evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Stress-test the design**
   - What single points of failure exist in the routing path?
   - What CEN bandwidth limits or quotas apply?
   - What security group rules are overly permissive?
   - What evidence is missing?
4. **Recommend the smallest safe next step**
   - Prefer staged rollout and rollback plan before production traffic cutover.
   - If the safest action is to gather more evidence, say that plainly.
