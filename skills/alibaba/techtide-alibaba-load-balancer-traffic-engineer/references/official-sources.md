## Grounding rule

Official documentation explains Alibaba Cloud LB service behavior and feature availability. It does not prove the user's current listener configuration, health check status, backend health, or WAF rule state. Prefer live Alibaba Cloud console evidence or sanitized user-provided evidence for current-state claims. NLB health check limitations (TCP only, no HTTP) are product constraints documented officially - do not assume HTTP health check support for NLB.
