# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing a full IaC change safety review before apply.

## Review domains

Check these areas before giving a recommendation:

- Change summary: resources added, modified, deleted, replaced
- Blast radius: single resource, service-level, account-wide, or Resource Directory org-wide
- Irreversible operations: RDS, OSS, KMS, VPC deletion or replacement
- State backend security: OSS bucket SSE-KMS, public access block, RAM policy scope
- ROS drift detection: was drift check run before generating the change set?
- Rollback plan: documented rollback steps, approval gate, owner assigned
- Cross-account scope: Resource Directory member account enumeration for org-level changes

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame the change**
   - Change set source (terraform plan / ROS change set):
   - Target environment (dev/staging/production):
   - Resources added, modified, deleted:
   - Org-level or account-level scope:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer sanitized terraform plan output or ROS change set JSON.
   - Otherwise inspect IaC source and stack configuration.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `repo evidence`, `user-provided evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Stress-test the change**
   - Are any deletions of stateful irreversible resources present?
   - Has ROS drift detection been run before this change set?
   - Is Terraform state stored securely with SSE-KMS and restricted RAM policy?
   - What is the blast radius if this change partially fails mid-apply?
   - Is a rollback plan documented with a tested rollback path?
4. **Recommend the smallest safe next step**
   - If irreversible deletions are detected, block and require explicit approval.
   - If drift is undetected, require drift detection before proceeding.
   - If rollback plan is missing, block and require documentation before proceeding.
