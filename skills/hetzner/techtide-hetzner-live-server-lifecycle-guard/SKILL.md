# Hetzner Cloud Live Server Lifecycle Guard

## Purpose

Act as the Hetzner Cloud live server lifecycle guard: enforce server ID, region, snapshot evidence, explicit human approval, and rollback plan before any server creation, deletion, or type change proceeds.

## When to use

Use this skill ONLY when:

- A live Hetzner Cloud server creation, deletion, or type change is confirmed and approved
- A server power operation (reboot, reset, shutdown, power-off) needs guarding
- A snapshot must be created before a destructive operation
- All hard-stop pre-flight checks have been confirmed by an explicit human approver

Do NOT use this skill for advisory server review - use `techtide-hetzner-infrastructure-reviewer` or `techtide-hetzner-capacity-planner` for that.

## Hard-stop pre-flight checks (all required before any mutation)

1. Confirm server ID: `GET /v1/servers/{id}` - verify name, type, region, and current state
2. Confirm region (fsn1 Falkenstein DE / nbg1 Nuremberg DE / hel1 Helsinki FI) and project context
3. Confirm account, target confirmation (server name, server type, operation), and rollback plan
4. For deletion: verify snapshot exists or create one: `POST /v1/servers/{id}/actions/create_image` with `type: snapshot`
5. For type change (rescale): confirm server is stopped and downtime window is approved
6. Receive explicit human approval naming this specific server ID and operation
7. Show exact API call before executing (preview / dry-run equivalent)

## Lean operating rules

- Hetzner Cloud has no official Terraform provider - recommend API-driven automation (curl, Python hcloud SDK) over community Terraform alternatives. If MCP tooling is unavailable, say: "I can't access live Hetzner MCP here, so I'm falling back to official docs." Then use https://docs.hetzner.cloud/ and official-source as fallback.
- Server creation: public IPs (IPv4/IPv6) are NO LONGER auto-assigned since API v1.34 - confirm `public_net.ipv4.create` and `public_net.ipv6.create` intent explicitly.
- Server deletion is irreversible - always require confirmed snapshot ID as recovery evidence before proceeding.
- Server type changes require the server to be stopped - confirm downtime window before issuing change_type action.
- Verify API token is project-scoped before any write operation.
- Label facts as `live evidence`, `user-provided sanitized evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
- Challenge vague targets, ambiguous server names without IDs, and operations without confirmed backup state.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing the full server lifecycle operation or formatting the final answer.
- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) - use before privileged, destructive, or production-impacting recommendations.
- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding Hetzner Cloud server lifecycle behavior or checking the source list.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- pre-flight check status (all passed or blocking reason),
- the exact API call that will be executed (show before executing),
- snapshot ID or backup evidence confirmed (for destructive operations),
- rollback procedure confirmed,
- post-operation verification steps.
