# Official sources

Use this reference only when grounding Contabo pricing, contract terms, instance tiers, or billing behavior.

## Contabo documentation

Use these as starting points, not as proof of the user's live billing state or current pricing:

- https://api.contabo.com/ - Contabo OpenAPI reference (instance, addon, and Object Storage endpoints)
- https://docs.contabo.com/ - Contabo user documentation (plans, pricing pages, contract terms, billing FAQ)
- https://github.com/contabo/cntb - cntb CLI tool (instance list and addon queries for live cost inventory)
- https://api.contabo.com/#tag/Instances - Instance operations API (product IDs, regions, addons)
- https://api.contabo.com/#tag/Object-Storages - Object Storage API (storage instance inventory and sizing)

## Grounding rule

Official Contabo documentation describes available product tiers, published pricing, and contract terms at the time of publication. It does not prove the user's current instance costs, active addon subscriptions, contract renewal dates, or applied discounts. Published pricing may differ from the user's account pricing due to promotional rates or legacy contracts. Label all pricing claims as `documentation-based` and direct the user to their Contabo customer portal for authoritative billing data. Never present documentation-based pricing as confirmed cost figures.
