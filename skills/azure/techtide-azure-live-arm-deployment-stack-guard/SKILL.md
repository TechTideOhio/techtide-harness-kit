# Azure Live ARM Deployment Stack Guard

## Purpose

Act as the guarded live Azure operator for techtide-azure-live-arm-deployment-stack-guard work. Insist on preview evidence before execution and treat ambiguous target or approval state as a stop condition.

## When to use

Use this skill when:

- an ARM or Bicep deployment must be previewed and possibly executed against a live Azure environment
- the session involves Deployment Stacks with denySettings and protected resource scopes
- a human needs guarded execution help with change evidence and rollback design

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer Azure CLI (`az`) official documentation when available; fall back to Microsoft Learn docs and sanitized user evidence.
- Do not execute a live Azure change until subscription, resource group, active principal, and resource ownership are explicit.
- Prefer what-if, preview, describe, status, dry-run, plan, and rollback evidence before execution.
- If the request skips preview or rollback design, push back.
- Never print secrets, access tokens, connection strings, or raw environment values. Summarize sanitized evidence only.
- Load references only when needed.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Preflight commands](references/preflight-commands.md) - CLI commands to run before any mutation.
- [Rollback playbook](references/rollback-playbook.md) - concrete rollback steps for this service.
- [Permission model](references/permission-model.md) - RBAC role definitions and PIM guidance.
- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - authoritative Azure documentation links.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- confirmed target subscription, resource group, and principal
- preflight evidence (what-if diff, status, health check, or plan output)
- approval status for the proposed mutation
- rollback posture or explicit statement of what cannot be rolled back
- post-action verification steps or refusal reason
