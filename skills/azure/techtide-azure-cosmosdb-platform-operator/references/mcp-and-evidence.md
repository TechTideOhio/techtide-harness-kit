# MCP and evidence path

Use this reference only when you need to decide how to gather evidence.

## Live-first evidence rule

1. Prefer live Azure MCP capability evidence when the active client exposes Azure tools.
2. Treat the runtime-exposed tool inventory as truth.
3. If Cosmos DB tooling is not exposed live, say so and switch to documentation-based guidance instead of pretending the namespace exists.

## Azure MCP grounding

Based on Microsoft documentation:

- Azure MCP supports a documented `cosmos` namespace in namespace mode.
- Microsoft recommends **consolidated mode** for AI agents because it reduces tool count and improves usability.
- Namespace filtering means a client may expose only a subset of Azure tools.

Implication:

- Do not assume that `cosmos` is available in the current runtime just because Microsoft documents it.
- If live MCP discovery is unclear, inspect or ask for the available Azure tool inventory before making namespace-specific claims.

## Evidence hierarchy

Use this order:

1. **live evidence** - Azure MCP output, sanitized screenshots, sanitized metrics, sanitized query results, or user-provided config excerpts
2. **user-provided sanitized evidence** - redacted portal output, SDK code, IaC snippets, logs, or query text
3. **documentation-based** - Microsoft Learn and official Azure MCP documentation
4. **inference** - conclusions derived from patterns but not directly proven by evidence
