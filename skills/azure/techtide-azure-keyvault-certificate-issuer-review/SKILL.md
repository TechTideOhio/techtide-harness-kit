# Azure Key Vault Certificate Issuer Review

## Purpose

Review Azure Key Vault configurations used as certificate issuers for cert-manager on AKS. Identify Managed Identity role assignment gaps (data plane vs management plane confusion), certificate policy misalignment, exportability risks, network connectivity issues, integrated CA credential over-scoping, and rotation race conditions between cert-manager and Key Vault auto-rotation. Output severity-labeled findings with evidence and remediation steps.

## Lean operating rules

- Check the Managed Identity (or Service Principal) role assignment on the Key Vault: the correct role is `Key Vault Certificate Officer` (data plane). Flag `Key Vault Contributor` as HIGH - it grants management plane access including vault deletion. Flag `Key Vault Administrator` as HIGH (full data plane + management).
- Verify whether Key Vault RBAC mode is enabled (`enableRbacAuthorization: true`). If legacy access policies are used instead of RBAC, flag as MEDIUM (harder to audit, no Azure AD Conditional Access integration).
- Review `exportable` in the Key Vault certificate policy. Flag `exportable: true` on certs used for cluster-internal mTLS as MEDIUM (private key unnecessarily extractable from Key Vault).
- Check Key Vault network access configuration: if `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled`, verify the AKS cluster has private endpoint access to the Key Vault and DNS resolution via private DNS zone. Flag missing private endpoint as MEDIUM.
- For integrated CAs (DigiCert, GlobalSign): verify the Key Vault has the CA integration configured and the credential secret is scoped to a minimum (single certificate profile, not account-wide).
- Review cert-manager `renewBefore` against the Key Vault certificate's auto-rotation policy to detect overlapping rotation windows. Flag simultaneous rotation triggers as MEDIUM.
- Label all findings as live evidence, documentation-based, or inference.
