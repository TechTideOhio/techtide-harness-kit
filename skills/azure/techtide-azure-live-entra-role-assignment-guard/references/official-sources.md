## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- The Azure RBAC API version for role assignments is `2022-04-01` (`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments`).
- Dangerous role definition IDs (stable - never rename): Owner `8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635`, Contributor `b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c`, User Access Administrator `18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9`.
- A permanent role assignment at subscription scope granted to a Guest user is one of the most common post-breach persistence techniques in Azure tenants - always block without explicit CISO-level sign-off.
- Azure AD token caching means a deleted assignment may still be honored for up to 5 minutes after deletion; do not declare rollback complete immediately.
- `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` at subscription scope is the permission that enables all downstream privilege escalation - any principal with it can assign themselves Owner.
- Prefer `az role assignment list --include-inherited` to find assignments at parent scopes that affect the target resource.
- Microsoft recommends group-based role assignment over direct user assignment to simplify access reviews and offboarding.
