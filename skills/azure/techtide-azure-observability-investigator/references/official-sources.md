## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- Resource logs do not become queryable just because a service exists; Microsoft explicitly states you need diagnostic settings to route them.
- Application Insights is part of Azure Monitor and depends on its underlying workspace and routing design; do not treat it as a standalone magic box.
- Microsoft recommends one Application Insights resource per workload per environment to avoid mixed telemetry and investigation confusion.
- Dashboards and workbooks are downstream views. If the underlying logs and metrics are missing or misrouted, the pretty dashboard proves nothing.
