## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- Virtual network peering is non-transitive. Any answer that assumes transitivity is broken.
- Private endpoints in spokes inject `/32` routes that propagate across peerings and VPN or ExpressRoute paths; if you ignore that, your topology advice is shallow.
- Private endpoint success depends on deliberate DNS zone linkage and resolution path, not just resource placement.
- In Virtual WAN, private endpoints belong in connected spoke virtual networks, not in the hub itself.
