## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- Ambient mode is a **layered architecture**: ztunnel handles L4 zero-trust for every pod in the mesh by default, and waypoint proxies are added only for the workloads that need L7 features (HTTP method/path matching, JWT claim authorization, request header inspection, traffic management).
- **An L7 `AuthorizationPolicy` rule on an ambient namespace with no waypoint is silently ignored.** The API server accepts the policy, but ztunnel only enforces L4 fields. This is the most-cited operational trap in ambient mode.
- The default action when no `AuthorizationPolicy` exists is **ALLOW**. Zero-trust posture requires explicit `DENY` policies or narrow `ALLOW` policies that collectively leave nothing reachable. `DENY` is evaluated before `ALLOW`.
- `PeerAuthentication` mTLS modes inherit from mesh → namespace → workload, with the most-specific policy winning. A mesh-wide `STRICT` policy can be locally weakened by a workload-scoped `DISABLE` policy on a specific port.
- Ambient mode requires **no pod restart** to add a workload to the mesh - labeling the namespace `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient` is sufficient. This is operationally simpler than sidecar injection but means changes can propagate faster than reviewers expect.
- The mesh root namespace (default `istio-system`, configurable via `meshConfig.rootNamespace`) is the only place where mesh-wide `PeerAuthentication` and `AuthorizationPolicy` can be authored. Anything there has cluster-wide blast radius.
- Waypoint placement uses Gateway API resources (`gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io`) labeled `istio.io/waypoint-for`. A namespace-level waypoint protects all workloads in the namespace; a ServiceAccount-level waypoint protects all workloads using that SA; a workload-level waypoint binds via `istio.io/use-waypoint` annotation.
- ztunnel uses the **HBONE protocol** (HTTP/2 over mTLS, port 15008) for ztunnel-to-ztunnel communication. Network policy that blocks 15008 between nodes will break ambient mesh traffic.
- Sidecar mode and ambient mode workloads can communicate within one mesh - Istio bridges between them transparently. Ambient pods see sidecar pod connections as mTLS-authenticated peers.
- `istioctl analyze` runs the same checks Istiod runs at startup and is the safest pre-apply validator. CI pipelines should run it on every Istio config change.
