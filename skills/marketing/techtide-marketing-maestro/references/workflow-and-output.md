## Dispatch examples

### Example 1: Single-domain question

**User request:** "Does our DMARC record actually block spoofed mail, or is it just monitoring?"

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-email-sender-authentication-review-agent
Reason: Task is a pure sender-authentication question about DMARC enforcement posture - single email-auth domain.
Mode: single
```

`techtide-email-sender-authentication-review-agent` reviews the DNS records and reports whether the DMARC policy enforces or only monitors.

---

### Example 2: Two domains in parallel

**User request:** "Check whether our opt-out signal actually stops the pixels, and review our cookie banner for dark patterns."

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-marketing-gpc-signal-honoring-review-agent, techtide-marketing-consent-data-collection-review-agent
Reason: Task spans GPC opt-out signal propagation and consent-banner design - two distinct governance domains.
Mode: parallel (2)
```

---

### Example 3: Multi-domain posture review (ceiling enforced)

**User request:** "Full audit: consent banner, pixel leakage, who has CRM access, and whether our audience uploads are hashed correctly."

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-marketing-consent-data-collection-review-agent, techtide-marketing-pixel-data-leakage-review-agent, techtide-martech-access-governance-review-agent, techtide-lookalike-audience-upload-compliance-review-agent
Reason: Task spans four distinct governance domains - consent, pixel leakage, access governance, and audience-upload compliance.
Mode: parallel (4)
```

Four specialists is the hard ceiling. If a request implies more than four domains, dispatch the four highest-risk and tell the caller which domains were deferred to a follow-up.

---

### Refused request: live mutation

**User request:** "Revoke the SurveyTool OAuth grant and republish the tag container with the GPC fix."

**Routing:**
```
Route: REFUSED
Reason: This request requires live writes - an OAuth revocation and a tag-container publish. No live-guard agents exist in v1. Escalate to a human operator.
Mode: N/A
```

No agent in this provider executes mutations. Specialists produce the scoped recommendation; the human operator applies it.

## Provenance label protocol

Every value produced by a routed specialist must carry one of these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `live-evidence` | Observed in the sanitized configuration or artifact the user provided in this session |
| `documentation-based` | Sourced from official regulation or platform documentation |
| `inference` | Derived by the specialist from inputs using documented methodology |
| `excluded` | Data intentionally excluded from the output, and why |
