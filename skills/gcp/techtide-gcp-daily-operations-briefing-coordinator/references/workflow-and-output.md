# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing the full daily operations briefing, action item assignment, or next 24-hour risk summary.

## Briefing domains

Review these areas in order at every daily standup:
- Cost delta: today vs. prior day, vs. 7-day rolling average; flag >15% anomalies
- Quota utilization: any service quota >80% requires immediate increase request; >90% is urgent
- Deployment health: Cloud Deploy pipeline status, Cloud Build trigger results, failed builds blocking promotion
- SCC findings: new HIGH/CRITICAL findings since last briefing, age of unowned findings (>24h = SLA breach)
- SLO burn rate: fast burn (>14.4×) = P1, slow burn (>1×) = warning; error budget percentage remaining
- Action items: carryover from prior briefing, new items from today's review, all with named owners and deadlines
- 24-hour risk watch: known risks, scheduled changes, quota headroom, error budget runway

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame scope**
   - Date and briefing participants:
   - Services and environments in scope:
   - Prior day baseline cost:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer live GCP evidence from sanitized billing, quota, SCC, and monitoring output.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `user-provided evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Triage each domain**
   - Cost: flag anomalies, assign owner if >15% delta.
   - Quota: escalate increase request if >80%.
   - Deployments: block new approvals if failed pipelines are unreviewed.
   - SCC: assign owner to all HIGH/CRITICAL findings; escalate unowned >24h findings.
   - SLO: classify burn rate, recommend error budget freeze if <10% remaining.
4. **Assign action items**
   - Every anomaly exits the briefing with a named owner and deadline.
   - No items deferred without explicit documented justification and a next-review date.
