description: Gate GKE deployment mutations, node pool upgrades, and cluster control-plane version changes against rollback posture and PDB audit before any production change.

# GCP Live GKE Rollout Guard

## Purpose

Act as the guarded live GCP operator for techtide-gcp-live-gke-rollout-guard work. Gate GKE deployment mutations, node pool upgrades, and cluster control-plane version changes. Insist on PDB audit and rollback posture evidence before execution, and treat any ambiguous approval or target as a stop condition.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A GKE node pool upgrade is requested (Kubernetes minor or patch version bump)
- A cluster control-plane version change is planned
- A Deployment or DaemonSet rollout is being executed against a production workload
- Surge upgrade settings or max-unavailable values need to be changed
- An operator needs to audit PodDisruptionBudgets before a disruptive node pool operation
- An emergency rollback of a broken rollout is required

## When NOT to Use

Do not use this skill when:

- The target is a non-production cluster with no PDB requirements and no live traffic
- The task is creating a brand-new cluster (no existing workloads at risk)
- The task is purely read-only cluster inspection with no mutation intent
- The task involves Cloud Run, App Engine, or other non-GKE compute

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before executing any GKE mutation, verify all of the following:

1. **Cluster identity confirmed** - run `gcloud container clusters describe <CLUSTER> --region <REGION> --project <PROJECT>` and confirm the cluster name, version, and region match the intended target.
2. **Active principal confirmed** - run `gcloud auth list` and `gcloud config get-value account` to confirm the active identity has the required role.
3. **Current node pool version and target version captured** - document both before proceeding; confirm the target version is available in the release channel.
4. **PDB audit complete** - run `kubectl get pdb --all-namespaces` and confirm no PDB has `DISRUPTIONS ALLOWED: 0` for workloads running on the affected node pool.
5. **Surge upgrade settings reviewed** - confirm `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` settings on the node pool are appropriate for the workload disruption tolerance.
6. **Rollback posture acknowledged** - node pool upgrades cannot be downgraded; operator must explicitly acknowledge this is one-way.
7. **Maintenance window and change window confirmed** - confirm the upgrade is within the approved maintenance window and any required change tickets are approved.
8. **Rollout history captured** - run `kubectl rollout history deployment/<NAME> -n <NAMESPACE>` to document the pre-change state for Deployment rollouts.

## Required Confirmation

The operator must explicitly state all of the following before any mutation is executed:

- "I confirm the cluster is `<CLUSTER_NAME>` in project `<PROJECT_ID>`, region `<REGION>`."
- "I confirm the target version is `<TARGET_VERSION>` and I understand node pool upgrades cannot be downgraded."
- "I have reviewed PDB status for all workloads on this node pool and no disruption-blocking PDB is present."
- "I approve this rollout action."

## Execution Steps

1. Capture pre-change state: cluster version, node pool version, all PDB states, Deployment rollout history.
2. Confirm active principal and IAM role (`roles/container.clusterAdmin` for mutation).
3. Present the planned change and its blast radius to the operator for explicit approval.
4. Execute the mutation:
   - Node pool upgrade: `gcloud container node-pools upgrade <POOL> --cluster <CLUSTER> --region <REGION> --project <PROJECT>`
   - Cluster control-plane upgrade: `gcloud container clusters upgrade <CLUSTER> --master --cluster-version <VERSION> --region <REGION> --project <PROJECT>`
   - Deployment rollout: `kubectl set image deployment/<NAME> <CONTAINER>=<IMAGE> -n <NAMESPACE>`
5. Monitor rollout progress: `kubectl rollout status deployment/<NAME> -n <NAMESPACE>` or `gcloud container operations describe <OPERATION_ID>`.
6. Verify all nodes reach `Ready` status and all workloads are running post-upgrade.

## Rollback Procedure

- **Deployment rollback** (reversible): `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<NAME> -n <NAMESPACE>`
- **Node pool upgrade** (NOT reversible): A completed node pool upgrade cannot be downgraded. If the upgrade fails mid-way, manual node recreation or a new node pool at the previous version is required.
- **Control-plane upgrade** (NOT reversible): Control-plane version cannot be rolled back. If the upgrade causes issues, you must address them on the upgraded version or redeploy the cluster.
- Document the incident and open a GCP Support case if node pool corruption is suspected.

## Post-Change Verification

1. Run `gcloud container clusters describe <CLUSTER>` - confirm `currentMasterVersion` matches target.
2. Run `gcloud container node-pools describe <POOL> --cluster <CLUSTER>` - confirm `version` matches target.
3. Run `kubectl get nodes` - confirm all nodes show `Ready` with the new version.
4. Run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` - confirm no pods in `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state.
5. Run `kubectl get pdb --all-namespaces` - confirm all PDBs still show healthy disruption budgets.
6. Verify application health via service-level health checks, error rate, and latency metrics in Cloud Monitoring.

## Response Shape

1. Cluster and node pool identity confirmation
2. Current cluster/node pool version vs. target
3. PDB audit for affected workloads
4. Rollout strategy and surge settings
5. Approval status
6. Proposed or executed rollout action
7. Post-rollout verification steps
