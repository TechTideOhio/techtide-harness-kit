## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- The Argo CD controller defaults to running as cluster-admin on every destination cluster. The `application.sync.impersonation.enabled` flag in `argocd-cm` is the switch that activates per-Application ServiceAccount impersonation via `destinationServiceAccounts` on the AppProject.
- `AppProject` boundaries are the only enforced isolation between teams sharing one Argo CD instance. Wildcards in `sourceRepos`, `destinations`, `clusterResourceWhitelist`, or empty `namespaceResourceBlacklist` collapse the boundary.
- `automated.selfHeal: true` combined with `automated.prune: true` means a Git revert (or Git outage that exposes a stale ref) deletes prod resources. There is no built-in confirmation step.
- ApplicationSet's `cluster` generator with an empty selector auto-onboards every newly registered cluster. This is the most-cited blast-radius mode in Argo CD post-incident reviews.
- ApplicationSet RollingSync intentionally forces auto-sync **disabled** on generated Applications (the controller logs warnings if any have auto-sync enabled). RollingSync drives sync via OutOfSync detection, not auto-sync.
- The `Replace=true` sync option is destructive on `StatefulSet`, `Service`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`, and any resource with finalizers. Argo CD's default three-way merge (or server-side apply on newer versions) is safer.
- Argo CD RBAC granular actions (e.g., `action/apps/Deployment/restart`, `action/argoproj.io/Rollout/abort`) shipped in v2.8+. Older policies that don't list these still work but won't grant the action - operators may discover gaps after upgrade.
- The `requireOverridePrivilegeForRevisionSync: true` flag in `argocd-cm` requires explicit `override` permission to sync to a non-tracked revision (e.g., a branch instead of HEAD of the configured target). This blocks easy ad-hoc syncs that bypass Git review.
- Argo CD Autopilot's bootstrap repo manages Argo CD itself - changes to that repo can disable RBAC, weaken AppProject scopes, or rotate the admin password. Treat the Autopilot repo as a tier-0 control surface.
- The Argo CD Agent (argocd-agent) introduces a hub-and-spoke topology where the central Argo CD installation does not hold cluster credentials for spoke clusters; agents connect outbound. Different threat model from the classic direct-cluster registration.
