## Grounded insights worth carrying into the skill

- `oci network security-list update` performs a **full replace** of the entire ingress or egress rule set - partial updates are not possible. Always pass the complete desired rule list including rules you want to keep.
- OCI Security Lists are **stateful by default** (`stateless: false`). Return traffic is automatically allowed. Stateless rules require explicit return rules and are a common source of asymmetric traffic failures.
- NSG rule IDs are required for deletion (`oci network nsg rules remove`). Capture rule IDs from `oci network nsg rules list` before any mutation.
- A Security List is attached to a subnet, not a VNIC. One change affects every instance in that subnet simultaneously - blast radius scales with subnet size.
- NSGs are attached to individual VNICs, giving finer-grained control but requiring per-VNIC management. Prefer NSGs for production database servers over Security Lists for reduced blast radius.
- VCN Flow Logs must be explicitly enabled per subnet - they are not on by default. Without them, there is no record of traffic through an accidentally opened rule.
- The `0.0.0.0/0` ingress source in OCI context still includes traffic from peered VCNs, DRG-attached networks, and FastConnect circuits if routing allows - it is never safe to assume it means "internet only."
