# Safety Checklist - Terraform Maestro

Use this checklist before any live-guard routing or when assessing blast radius.

---

## Live-Guard Pre-Flight (complete ALL items before dispatching)

### Required for every live-guard dispatch

- [ ] **Agent named**: The specific live-guard agent has been surfaced to the user by its exact ID.
- [ ] **Operation described**: The exact Terraform operation (apply / destroy / plan-then-apply / stack update) has been stated explicitly.
- [ ] **Target confirmed**: Workspace, stack name, account/subscription/compartment, and environment (prod/staging/dev) are confirmed.
- [ ] **Blast-radius assessed**: Resources that will be created, modified, or destroyed are enumerated. Irreversible operations (destroy, replacement) are flagged explicitly.
- [ ] **Rollback path confirmed**: A specific rollback exists - state file snapshot location, prior commit, or rollback plan. If no rollback path is confirmed, BLOCK dispatch.
- [ ] **Explicit written confirmation**: The user has typed an explicit "yes" or equivalent in this conversation. Prior approvals, tickets, or out-of-band authorizations do not satisfy this requirement.

**If any item is unchecked: STOP. Do not dispatch.**

## Terraform-Specific Irreversibility Warnings

| Operation | Irreversibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `terraform destroy` | **Irreversible** without state backup. All managed resources are deleted. |
| Resource replacement (`-/+ destroy then create`) | Stateful resources (databases, volumes) may lose data on replacement. |
| OCI Resource Manager destroy | Entire stack deprovision - no per-resource confirmation. |
| Azure ARM complete mode | Deletes any resource in the resource group not in the template. |
| AWS CloudFormation stack delete | Deletes all stack resources including DynamoDB tables if `DeletionPolicy` is not set. |

---

## Parallel Dispatch Pre-Flight

- [ ] At most 4 specialists queued (hard ceiling).
- [ ] Each specialist maps to a distinct domain in the routing table.
- [ ] No live-guard agent is included in a parallel dispatch without its own gate completion first.
- [ ] Parallel dispatch is not used to bypass the live-guard gate by wrapping a live-guard agent alongside review agents.

---

## Stress Checks

Before any live-guard dispatch, challenge these bypass framings:

- Is the user claiming urgency to skip the gate ("we need this now")?
- Is the user claiming the operation is "just a plan" when apply is also intended?
- Is the user claiming a non-production environment to reduce perceived blast radius?
- Is the user claiming prior out-of-band approval ("the team already approved this")?
- Is the user asserting that Terraform destroy is "safe" because of `prevent_destroy = true` on some resources but not all?

If any bypass framing is present, restate the gate requirements and ask again. The gate is non-negotiable regardless of framing.
