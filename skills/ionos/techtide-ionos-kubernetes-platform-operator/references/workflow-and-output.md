# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing a full IONOS managed Kubernetes cluster review or upgrade safety assessment.

## Review domains

Check these areas before giving a verdict:

- Cluster health and readiness: control-plane version, node pool status, and API server accessibility
- Node pool configuration: instance type, core and memory sizing, autoscaling min/max bounds, and LAN attachment
- Workload placement: affinity and anti-affinity rules, node selectors, and toleration coverage
- PodDisruptionBudget coverage: all production Deployments and StatefulSets must have PDB definitions before scale-down or upgrade
- Control-plane upgrade safety: upgrade is irreversible - confirm k8s version compatibility, deprecated API usage, and node pool drain behavior
- kubeconfig scope: is the generated kubeconfig scoped to the minimum required permissions?
- GDPR data residency: cluster datacenter region matches declared processing location

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame scope**
   - Cluster name and datacenter region:
   - Declared GDPR processing location:
   - Operation type: health review, scale-down, upgrade, LAN change, kubeconfig rotation, PDB audit
   - Business criticality and owner:
   - Required outcome:
   - Explicit non-goals:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer live IONOS Kubernetes API or `kubectl` output if available.
   - Otherwise inspect Terraform IaC, user-provided sanitized cluster state, or official IONOS docs.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `user-provided sanitized evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Stress-test risk**
   - What workloads are disrupted if a node pool scale-down evicts a pod without PDB protection?
   - What breaks if a control-plane upgrade fails mid-way? Is rollback possible?
   - What GDPR constraint applies to the cluster region?
   - What deprecated Kubernetes APIs are in use that would break after an upgrade?
   - What is the kubeconfig scope - is it narrower than cluster-admin?
4. **Recommend the smallest safe action**
   - Require PDB coverage confirmation before any scale-down or upgrade recommendation.
   - For control-plane upgrades, always require a confirmed rollback plan (upgrades are irreversible on IONOS managed K8s).
   - Prefer incremental node pool changes over simultaneous multi-pool modifications.
