| `cloud-pricing` | Public pricing API, on-demand compute, storage, data-transfer pricing, multi-cloud price comparison, cost estimate, prototype architecture pricing, pricing by region and tier |

## Dispatch examples

### Example 1: AI model cost comparison

**User request:** "Compare the per-token cost of Claude Sonnet 4 on Bedrock versus Azure OpenAI GPT-4o."

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent
Reason: Task is a pure foundation model pricing comparison across two providers - single AI-economics domain.
Mode: single
```

`techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent` fetches current public pricing for both models, builds a cost-per-token comparison table labeled with provenance, and highlights cached-token pricing where available.

---

### Example 2: Kubernetes pod rightsizing + AI inference cost

**User request:** "Rightsize our GPU pods running inference workloads and estimate the model cost for the requests they serve."

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-finops-kubernetes-rightsizer-agent, techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent
Reason: Task spans Kubernetes pod rightsizing (CPU/memory/GPU requests from p95 metrics) and AI model cost economics (per-token inference spend) - two distinct FinOps domains.
Mode: parallel (2)
```

`techtide-finops-kubernetes-rightsizer-agent` reviews pod specs and utilization metrics to produce right-sized request/limit recommendations; `techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent` estimates the per-token cost curve for the served models, including batch vs real-time pricing trade-offs.

---

### Example 3: Multi-cloud compute pricing comparison

**User request:** "What is the on-demand price for a 96-vCPU compute-optimized instance on AWS, Azure, and GCP in us-east?"

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-finops-cloud-price-advisor-agent
Reason: Task is a multi-cloud on-demand compute price comparison - single cloud-pricing domain.
Mode: single
```

`techtide-finops-cloud-price-advisor-agent` fetches live prices from AWS, Azure, and GCP public pricing APIs for the requested instance family and region, returns a line-item table with source timestamps, and notes any equivalent SKU caveats.

---

### Example 4: Full FinOps posture review - AI costs, K8s allocation, and cloud pricing

**User request:** "Review our AI inference spend, identify over-provisioned pods, and benchmark our cloud pricing against alternatives."

**Routing:**
```
Route: techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent, techtide-finops-kubernetes-rightsizer-agent, techtide-finops-cloud-price-advisor-agent
Reason: Task spans AI model cost economics, Kubernetes workload rightsizing, and cloud on-demand pricing benchmarking - three distinct FinOps domains.
Mode: parallel (3)
```

`techtide-finops-ai-economist-agent` analyzes AI inference spend by model and provider; `techtide-finops-kubernetes-rightsizer-agent` reviews pod utilization metrics and produces rightsizing recommendations with estimated monthly savings; `techtide-finops-cloud-price-advisor-agent` benchmarks current compute pricing against equivalent SKUs on alternative clouds. Hard-ceiling of 4 specialists; this stays under the limit.

---

### Refused request: live billing mutation

**User request:** "Apply a budget alert on my AWS account for the ML team at $5,000/month."

**Routing:**
```
Route: REFUSED
Reason: This request requires a live write to a billing system. No live-guard agents exist in v1. Escalate to a human operator with AWS Cost Management console access.
Mode: N/A
```

No agent in this catalog executes billing mutations, budget writes, or alert configuration. The human operator must apply this change using the AWS Cost Management console or Terraform. The `techtide-finops-cloud-price-advisor-agent` can estimate the projected spend, but no agent writes to external systems.

## Provenance label protocol

Every value produced by a routed specialist must carry one of these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `live-evidence` | Fetched from a live public API or tool output within this session |
| `documentation-based` | Sourced from official documentation; may not reflect the current live price |
| `inference` | Derived by the skill from inputs using documented methodology |
| `excluded` | Data that was intentionally excluded from the output and why |
