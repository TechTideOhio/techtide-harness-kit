# Provider Fallbacks

Decision tree for each provider: when to use a live API versus cached documentation pricing.
Used in conjunction with [./pricing-apis.md](./pricing-apis.md) and
[./official-sources.md](./official-sources.md).

---

## Fallback Principle

Every provider follows the same three-tier priority:

```
1. Live API   - real-time prices; highest accuracy; label: live-price
2. Scrape     - fetch official pricing page via WebFetch; label: documentation-based
3. Cached docs - static pricing from this reference file; label: documentation-based (stale)
```

Use the highest tier available given the request context. Always attach a provenance label
and, for live prices, the response timestamp.

---

## Security Rules (All Providers)

These rules apply without exception across every provider and every fallback tier:

- **Never prompt users for credentials.** If a key is needed and not provided, drop to the
  next fallback tier silently.
- **If the user explicitly includes a key in their request**, use it once for the live API
  call, then discard it. Log the following message and nothing else about the key:
  > "User-provided API key received; using live pricing. Key will not be stored."
- **Never log or echo the key value itself.** Do not include it in intermediate results,
  debug output, or citations.
- **Never store, cache, or carry a key across turns.** Each request is a fresh context;
  any key from a prior turn must not be assumed to be present.
- **Label all outputs** with the correct provenance tier. A `documentation-based` label is
  not a failure - it is honest and expected when no key is available.

## CNY→USD Conversion Fallback

Used whenever Alibaba Cloud (mainland `cn-*` regions) or Tencent Cloud (mainland regions)
prices are expressed in CNY and must be converted to USD for reporting.

### Decision tree

```
CNY price obtained (any tier)
    │
    ├─ Tier 1 - ExchangeRate-API (preferred, no auth)
    │     Fetch: https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/CNY
    │     On success  → use CNY-per-USD rate from response
    │                   record: conversion_rate, source_url, timestamp (ISO 8601)
    │     On failure  → fall through to Tier 2
    │
    ├─ Tier 2 - ECB daily feed (EUR base; cross-rate via USD)
    │     Fetch: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml
    │     Derive CNY/USD cross-rate: CNY_per_USD = (ECB CNY_per_EUR) / (ECB USD_per_EUR)
    │     On success  → use derived rate
    │                   record: conversion_rate, source_url, timestamp (ISO 8601)
    │     On failure  → fall through to Tier 3
    │
    ├─ Tier 3 - Cached rate (stale fallback of last resort)
    │     Use the most recently known CNY/USD rate from this reference file
    │     Label: assumed: 24h stale
    │     Include note: "Exchange rate could not be refreshed; rate may be stale - verify
    │                    at https://www.pbc.gov.cn/ before relying on this conversion"
    │
    └─ END
```

### Mandatory output fields for every CNY→USD conversion

| Field | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| `conversion_rate` | float (CNY per USD) | `7.25` |
| `source_url` | string | `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/CNY` |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | `2026-05-13T08:00:00Z` |

If the rate is from Tier 3 (stale), also include:
- `staleness_label`: `assumed: 24h stale`
- `verify_url`: `https://www.pbc.gov.cn/`

### Example labels

Tier 1 or Tier 2 (live rate):
```
[documentation-based + live-rate: 7.25 CNY/USD @ 2026-05-13T08:00:00Z via https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/CNY]
```

Tier 3 (stale cached rate):
```
[documentation-based + assumed: 24h stale rate 7.25 CNY/USD - verify at https://www.pbc.gov.cn/]
```

## Fallback Failure Handling

If all available tiers fail for any provider:

1. Return a `fetch-failed` label on the affected line item.
2. State which tiers were attempted and what errors were returned (HTTP status or timeout).
3. Include an explicit uncertainty warning:
   > "Price for {provider} {resource} could not be confirmed. Omitted from total. Retry
   > or consult {pricing-page-url} directly."
4. Do not substitute a guess or a memorized price without a label.
