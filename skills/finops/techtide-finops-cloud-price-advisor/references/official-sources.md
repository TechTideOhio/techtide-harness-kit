> Scaleway pricing is EUR-native. No USD pricing is available via the API. Use a live
> exchange rate source (see Exchange Rate Sources below) to convert to USD or other
> currencies. The `billing/v2beta1` API endpoint requires a Scaleway IAM token; the
> official pricing page is the reliable unauthenticated fallback. Verify beta API status
> at https://www.scaleway.com/en/changelog/ before any integration.

## Gandi

> Gandi pricing is available in both EUR and USD via the API response. The Price List API
> requires a user-provided API key (`Authorization: Apikey <key>`). The agent never prompts
> for, stores, or logs API keys. If no key is supplied in the request, fall back to the
> official pricing page and label the estimate as `documentation-based`.

> Alibaba Cloud has no public unauthenticated pricing API. Pricing is obtained by scraping
> the official pricing page via WebFetch. An HTML parser is required; the page does not
> expose a JSON feed. All prices must be labeled `documentation-based`. For mainland
> (`cn-*`) regions, prices are in CNY; apply a CNY-to-USD conversion with a live rate and
> timestamp (see CNY section below). International (`ap-*`, `us-*`, `eu-*`) regions are
> priced in USD. See [./provider-fallbacks.md](./provider-fallbacks.md) for the full

## Exchange Rate Sources

| Source | URL | Auth | Notes |
|--------|-----|------|-------|
| ExchangeRate-API (preferred) | `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD` | None | Major currencies; updated daily |
| ECB daily reference rates (fallback) | `https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml` | None | EUR-denominated; reliable but limited currency set |
| ExchangeRate-API CNY endpoint | `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/CNY` | None | CNY-denominated; use for CNY→USD conversion; updated daily |
| PBoC daily rate (CNY cached fallback) | `https://www.pbc.gov.cn/` | None | People's Bank of China published daily rate; use when ExchangeRate-API is unavailable |

Do not use sources that require API keys (e.g., openexchangerates.org). The agent must not accept or store API keys.

## Grounding Rule

When a live API fetch returns a price that differs significantly from the official pricing page, prefer the live API result (it is more current) but note the discrepancy. If the API result appears clearly wrong (e.g., $0.00 or orders-of-magnitude off), fall back to the official pricing page and label the estimate as `documentation-based`.
