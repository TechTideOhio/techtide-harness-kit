# Pricing APIs

Public pricing endpoints for AWS, Azure, OCI, Scaleway, Gandi, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.
Alibaba and Tencent have no unauthenticated public API; pricing is obtained via web scrape.

---

## AWS - Price List API

**Base URL**: `https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

No authentication. No API key. No AWS account needed.

### Service index

```
GET https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/index.json
```

Returns a JSON map of all service codes and their per-service offer file paths.

### Per-service, per-region offer file

```
GET https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/{serviceCode}/current/{regionCode}/index.json
```

Examples:
```
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonEC2/current/us-east-1/index.json
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonRDS/current/us-east-1/index.json
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonS3/current/us-east-1/index.json
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonECS/current/us-east-1/index.json
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AWSLambda/current/us-east-1/index.json
```

⚠️ These files are very large (EC2 index is tens of MB). Use the CSV variant for scripting:
```
https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/{serviceCode}/current/{regionCode}/index.csv
```

### Key response fields

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "partNumber": "B88317",
      "displayName": "VM.Standard.E4.Flex - OCPU",
      "currencyCodeLocalizations": [
        {
          "currencyCode": "USD",
          "prices": [
            {
              "model": "PAY_AS_YOU_GO",
              "value": "0.025",
              "unit": "OCPU Per Hour"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alternative: Oracle Cloud Pricing page JSON

```
GET https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/cloud/oci-price-list.json
```

This is the machine-readable version of the Oracle Cloud Price List. Structure may vary by release.

### Oracle pricing page (human-readable)

```
https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list.html
```

### OCI shape pricing pattern

OCI Flex VMs charge separately per OCPU and per GB of memory:
- Compute: OCPU-hour rate × number of OCPUs
- Memory: GB-hour rate × number of GB RAM
- Standard shapes (non-Flex): flat hourly rate per shape

### OCI regions for pricing context

OCI pricing is generally region-independent for compute (same price globally), but data egress and some services do vary. Always confirm whether the target workload has significant egress.

## Scaleway - Billing API (beta) / Pricing Page

**Stable fallback**: `https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/`

The Scaleway billing catalog API was in active beta as of mid-2025. Until it reaches GA,
treat the official pricing page as the authoritative source for documentation-based estimates.
The beta endpoint is documented below for completeness.

> **Note**: Scaleway pricing is EUR-native. USD conversion must be handled separately using
> a live exchange rate source (see [./official-sources.md](./official-sources.md) - Exchange
> Rate Sources). Always display the EUR price first, then the converted amount with the
> conversion date and rate used.

### Beta billing catalog endpoint

```
GET https://api.scaleway.com/billing/v2beta1/products
X-Auth-Token: <IAM-API-key>
```

Requires a valid Scaleway IAM API key with at minimum `billing:read` permission scope.

### Key response fields (beta)

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "instances_b_ssd_x86_64_pro2_xs",
      "display_name": "Production PRO2-XS",
      "region": "fr-par",
      "price": {
        "currency_code": "EUR",
        "units": 0,
        "nanos": 4300000
      },
      "unit_of_measure": "hour"
    }
  ]

## Alibaba Cloud - Scrape-Based Pricing

**No public unauthenticated pricing API exists for Alibaba Cloud.**

Pricing is obtained by scraping the official pricing page. All estimates derived
from this source must be labeled `documentation-based`. See
[./provider-fallbacks.md](./provider-fallbacks.md) for the full scrape fallback chain.

### Primary pricing source

```
https://www.alibabacloud.com/cloud-computing/pricing
```

HTML page containing product cards and pricing zones per region.
An HTML parser is required; the page does not expose a JSON feed.

### Cost calculator (secondary source)

```
https://www.alibabacloud.com/price-calculator
```

Use as a fallback when the primary pricing page cannot be parsed.

### Authentication

None required. Public page, no API key.

### Rate limits

No explicit rate limit published. Treat as a standard web scrape:
- Do not send more than one request per session for pricing data.
- Do not retry aggressively on failure; fall back to cached data instead.

### Regions supported

| Region type | Region codes |
|-------------|-------------|
| Mainland China (CNY) | `cn-beijing`, `cn-shanghai`, `cn-zhangjiakou`, `cn-hangzhou`, `cn-shenzhen` |

## WebFetch Usage Notes

When calling these endpoints via WebFetch:
- AWS EC2 `index.json` for a single region is very large. Fetch the CSV variant or use the JSON and filter in-context.
- Azure API returns paginated results; follow `NextPageLink` if present.
- OCI API returns a single large array; filter by `displayName` substring or `partNumber` after fetch.
- Scaleway billing API (`/billing/v2beta1/products`) requires an `X-Auth-Token` header. If no token is available, fall back to the official pricing page and label the estimate as `documentation-based`. The beta endpoint may return `404` or an undocumented error shape before GA.
- Gandi price list API (`/v5/price-list`) requires `Authorization: Apikey <key>`. If the user has not provided a key in the current request, do not prompt - fall back to the official pricing page (https://www.gandi.net/domain/pricing) and label the estimate as `documentation-based`. If a user-provided key is present, log: "User-provided API key received; using live pricing. Key will not be stored." then discard the key after the fetch.
- Alibaba Cloud pricing page (`https://www.alibabacloud.com/cloud-computing/pricing`) is scrape-based; no JSON API exists. Parse HTML product cards. If the page structure has changed or the fetch fails, fall back to the price calculator page, then to a cached documentation-based estimate. Label all Alibaba prices as `documentation-based`. For mainland (`cn-*`) regions, always apply a CNY-to-USD conversion with a live rate and timestamp.
- Tencent Cloud pricing page (`https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cvm/pricing`) is scrape-based; JavaScript rendering may be required. If the primary page fails, fall back to `https://cloud.tencent.com/price`, then to a cached documentation-based estimate. Label all Tencent prices as `documentation-based`. For mainland (`ap-beijing`, `ap-shanghai`, `ap-guangzhou`) regions, always apply a CNY-to-USD conversion with a live rate and timestamp.
- If a fetch fails (network timeout, 403, 429), label the result as `fetch-failed` and fall back to documentation-based estimate with explicit uncertainty warning.
