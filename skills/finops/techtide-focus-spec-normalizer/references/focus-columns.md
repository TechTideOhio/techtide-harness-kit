## Notes on null handling

FOCUS requires that required columns be present in every conformant row. When a vendor billing format does not supply data for a required FOCUS column, set the value to `null` and document the gap. A null in a required column indicates a normalization gap, not a schema violation, as long as it is disclosed.

For `EffectiveCost`, `ListCost`, and `ContractedCost`: many vendors do not provide all three in their standard export formats. AWS CUR provides `lineItem/UnblendedCost` (≈ ListCost for on-demand, ≈ EffectiveCost for RI/SP amortized), but not a separate ListCost column. Document which cost columns map to which FOCUS columns and note any amortization assumptions.
