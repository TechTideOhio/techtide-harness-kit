## Fetch strategy

When using WebFetch against a pricing page:

1. Fetch the canonical pricing URL listed above.
2. Record the response timestamp in UTC (ISO 8601, e.g., `2026-05-13T14:32Z`).
3. Extract the relevant model row(s) for the requested model name or family.
4. If the page uses JavaScript to render a pricing table, it may return partial or placeholder content - in that case, label the result `documentation-based` and note the URL fetched.
5. If the fetch fails entirely, fall back to the most recent documentation-based price known and label it `documentation-based` with the documentation URL.
