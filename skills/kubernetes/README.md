## Portfolio posture

Kubernetes skills for evidence-backed RBAC review and guarded live cluster mutation.

These skills are intentionally conservative:

- prefer `kubectl auth can-i` and `kubectl get ... -o yaml` for live state grounding before any review or mutation
- capture the full current RBAC object state before every write - RBAC is additive with no built-in undo
- treat `escalate`, `bind`, and `impersonate` verbs as hard stops requiring platform-team sign-off
- never approve wildcard verb/resource grants (`verbs: ["*"]` or `resources: ["*"]`) without CISO-level justification
- always assess cluster-scope vs namespace-scope necessity - prefer a Role over a ClusterRole when namespace scope is sufficient
- use official Kubernetes documentation for RBAC behavior and policy

Network architecture review covers the cluster's dataplane, Service surface, Ingress and Gateway API, DNS, and multi-cluster topology - it stays read-only and delegates NetworkPolicy content review and live mutations to dedicated agents.
