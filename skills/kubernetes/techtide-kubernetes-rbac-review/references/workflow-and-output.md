# Workflow and Output Contract

## Workflow

1. Identify the target: namespace-scoped Role/RoleBinding or cluster-scoped ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding.
2. Identify the principal: ServiceAccount, user, or Group (including `system:` groups).
3. Prefer namespace-scoped Roles before ClusterRoles when the workload only operates in one namespace.
4. Challenge dangerous defaults:
   - `cluster-admin` ClusterRoleBinding for any non-infrastructure workload,
   - Wildcard verbs (`*`) or wildcard resources (`*`) in any Role or ClusterRole,
   - Wildcard API groups (`*`) that grant cross-group access,
   - Binding to the `default` ServiceAccount (shared blast radius),
   - `automountServiceAccountToken: true` (default) on pods that do not need API server access,
   - ClusterRoleBindings where a RoleBinding to a namespaced ClusterRole would suffice,
   - Aggregated ClusterRoles with labels that may attract unexpected rules from third-party operators.
5. **Check privilege-escalation verbs explicitly** - these three verbs bypass Kubernetes' own escalation prevention controls and must be flagged as high severity whenever present:
   - `escalate` on `clusterroles` or `roles` - allows granting permissions the subject does not itself hold; the textbook Kubernetes privilege escalation path,
   - `bind` on `clusterroles`, `roles`, `clusterrolebindings`, or `rolebindings` - allows creating bindings to roles the subject is not bound to,
   - `impersonate` on `users`, `groups`, or `serviceaccounts` - allows acting as any other identity, bypassing all authentication controls.
6. Check whether RBAC controls reach high-severity resources:
   - `secrets` (get/list at ClusterRole scope = read every secret cluster-wide),
   - `pods/exec` and `pods/attach` (interactive shell on any pod - same severity),
   - `pods/portforward` (tunnel to pod ports),
   - `nodes/proxy` (proxy to kubelet API on every node - effectively cluster-admin for node operations),
   - `nodes`, `namespaces`, `clusterroles`, `clusterrolebindings`.
7. Stress-test operational hygiene:
   - prefer dedicated ServiceAccounts per workload over shared accounts,
   - prefer explicit `resources` lists over wildcards,
   - prefer explicit `verbs` lists (`get`, `list`, `watch`) over `*`,
   - challenge escalation paths: can the bound account create/update Roles or RoleBindings?

## Output

Return:

- current access summary,
- risk findings (with severity: high / medium / low),
- least-privilege alternative,
- validation commands or manifest corrections,
- assumptions and missing facts.

## Security notes

Do not suggest `cluster-admin` bindings or wildcard grants unless the user has explicitly justified the blast radius and there is no namespace-scoped alternative.
