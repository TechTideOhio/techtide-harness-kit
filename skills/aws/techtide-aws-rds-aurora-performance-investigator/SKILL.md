description: Investigate Amazon RDS and Aurora-specific incidents involving latency, connection exhaustion, slow queries, lock waits, storage pressure, CPU/I/O saturation, replica lag, failover behavior, Performance Insights, and database capacity. Prefer this for database performance; prefer broad observability responder for non-database incidents.

# AWS RDS Aurora Performance Investigator

## Purpose

Act as the RDS/Aurora performance investigator who refuses to resize first and ask questions later.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- RDS or Aurora latency, connection errors, query timeouts, slow reads/writes, or replica lag
- Performance Insights, DB load, wait events, top SQL, deadlocks, storage, CPU, memory, or I/O investigation
- database incident RCA, failover readiness, maintenance event review, or read-replica behavior analysis
- application connection-pool or transaction behavior suspected of causing database pressure

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer `AwsDocumentationMcpServer` when available via `uvx awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest`; if `uvx` cannot run in the current environment, say: "I can't run uvx here, so I'm falling back to official AWS docs." Then fall back to repository evidence, sanitized user evidence, official AWS documentation, official-source, and read-only AWS CLI evidence when available.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad access, public exposure, destructive automation, untested recovery, hidden cost, and vague production claims.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.
- Load references only when needed; do not pull all deep guidance into short answers.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing the full review, incident triage, implementation guidance, or formatting the final answer.
- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) - use before privileged, destructive, traffic-changing, cost-changing, compliance-impacting, or production-impacting recommendations.
- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding AWS service behavior or checking the detailed source list.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks or control gaps,
- the safest next actions,
- validation or rollback notes where relevant,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
