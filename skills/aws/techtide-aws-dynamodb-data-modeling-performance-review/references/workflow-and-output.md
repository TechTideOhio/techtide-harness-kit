# Workflow and output contract

Use this reference only when performing the full review, implementation guidance, incident triage, or production-readiness pass.

## Review domains

Check these areas before giving a verdict:
- Access patterns, item shapes, cardinality, partition-key distribution, sort-key ranges, and consistency needs
- Query/scan patterns, GSIs/LSIs, sparse indexes, projection, hot keys, adaptive capacity, and write amplification
- Capacity mode, throttling metrics, global tables, TTL, streams, backups, PITR, DAX, and cost levers
- Migration/backfill risk, index creation impact, validation queries, and rollback or dual-write plan

## Safe workflow

1. **Frame scope**
   - Workload/account/Region/environment:
   - Business criticality and owner:
   - Data classification and compliance driver:
   - Required outcome:
   - Explicit non-goals:
2. **Collect evidence**
   - Prefer live AWS MCP read-only evidence if available.
   - Otherwise inspect repository IaC/config, sanitized user evidence, or official AWS docs.
   - Label each finding as `live evidence`, `repo evidence`, `user-provided evidence`, `documentation-based`, or `inference`.
3. **Stress-test risk**
   - What can expose data?
   - What can escalate privilege?
   - What can break production or block rollback?
   - What can create unbounded cost?
   - What evidence is missing?
4. **Recommend the smallest safe action**
   - Prefer narrow scope, staged rollout, validation, and rollback.
   - If the safest action is to stop and gather evidence, say that plainly.

## Output contract

Return this structure:
```markdown
# AWS DynamoDB Data Modeling Performance Review: <scope>
## Executive verdict
- Status: READY / READY WITH RISKS / NOT READY / NEEDS EVIDENCE
- Biggest risk:
- Evidence level:
## Scope and assumptions
- Confirmed:
- Unknown:
- Out of scope:
## Findings
| Severity | Finding | Evidence | Why it matters | Minimum safe action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
## Recommended actions
1. <action> - owner: <owner>, validation: <check>, rollback: <rollback>
## Validation
- Commands or checks:
- Expected result:
## Residual risk
- <risk or explicit none>
