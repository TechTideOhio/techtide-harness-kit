## Grounded notes from official-source

- Current AWS devguide guidance says the recommended CLI install for new projects is `npm install -g @aws/agentcore`.
- The AgentCore CLI is the Node.js command-line tool for creating, configuring, deploying, and managing agents and uses project JSON config under the `agentcore/` directory, including `agentcore.json` and `aws-targets.json`.
- AgentCore tool configuration can include remote MCP servers, AgentCore Gateway, Browser, Code Interpreter, and inline functions.
- For managed credential rotation and API key storage, prefer AgentCore Gateway and AgentCore Identity over raw authentication headers.
- AgentCore Observability uses CloudWatch metrics for runtime, memory, gateway, built-in tools, and identity resources; custom runtime metrics need instrumentation such as AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
- AgentCore offers two distinct paths: code-based agents and the managed harness. Current AWS docs describe the code-based agent path as generally available and the config-based harness path as preview.
- Skills referenced with `--skill-path` must already exist inside the runtime container or session environment. The path reference does not upload the skill for you.
- Gateway creation is not the end of the security model. Official policy docs show Cedar-based policy enforcement is a separate control plane you must design explicitly.
- Harness security docs say SigV4 callers do not get per-user identity propagation into downstream tools. User-scoped token vault and on-behalf-of flows require the OAuth bearer-token path.
- Harness overview docs note regional rollout is ongoing and the currently documented harness availability is limited; do not assume every AgentCore feature is live in every region.
- Official harness docs describe `agentcore invoke --exec` shell access to the session environment, but installed CLI surfaces can drift. Verify the local CLI before promising that workflow.

## Starter toolkit caveat

- The Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit repository is still useful for migration and existing Python-based workflows.
- Based on current official AWS devguide evidence, do not present the starter toolkit as the recommended starting point for new projects when the newer `@aws/agentcore` CLI is available.

## Grounding rule

Docs explain service behavior. They do not prove the user's installed CLI version, active AWS account, IAM role, Region support, quotas, deployed AgentCore resources, or whether preview-only features are enabled in that account.
