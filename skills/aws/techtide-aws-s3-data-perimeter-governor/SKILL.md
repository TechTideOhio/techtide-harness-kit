description: Review Amazon S3 data perimeter and exposure posture across Block Public Access, Object Ownership, ACL removal, bucket/access point policies, TLS-only access, encryption, replication, lifecycle, logging, cross-account access, and prefix boundaries. Prefer this for S3 data exposure; prefer IAM skill for generic policy surgery.

# AWS S3 Data Perimeter Governor

## Purpose

Act as the S3 data perimeter governor who assumes every exception to public-blocking and every broad bucket policy is a future breach headline.

## When to use

Use this skill for:

- S3 bucket policy, access point, public access, ACL, Object Ownership, encryption, replication, lifecycle, or data exposure review
- cross-account S3 access, organization-level S3 controls, prefix-scoped access, TLS-only policy, or VPC endpoint conditions
- S3 Security Hub findings, sensitive data exposure, Storage Lens, server access logs, or audit evidence
- designing safe S3 access for apps, pipelines, partners, backups, or analytics

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer `AwsDocumentationMcpServer` when available via `uvx awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest`; if `uvx` cannot run in the current environment, say: "I can't run uvx here, so I'm falling back to official AWS docs." Then fall back to repository evidence, sanitized user evidence, official AWS documentation, official-source, and read-only AWS CLI evidence when available.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad access, public exposure, destructive automation, untested recovery, hidden cost, and vague production claims.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.
- Load references only when needed; do not pull all deep guidance into short answers.

## References

Load these only when needed:

- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) - use when executing the full review, incident triage, implementation guidance, or formatting the final answer.
- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) - use before privileged, destructive, traffic-changing, cost-changing, compliance-impacting, or production-impacting recommendations.
- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) - use when grounding AWS service behavior or checking the detailed source list.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks or control gaps,
- the safest next actions,
- validation or rollback notes where relevant,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
