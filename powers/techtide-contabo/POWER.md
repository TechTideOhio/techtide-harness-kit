# TechTide Frontier - Contabo

Curated Contabo agents for security hardening, cost optimization, capacity planning, and live instance-lifecycle and storage-operations guards. Routes via the Contabo pattern to specialist agents. Mutations on real Contabo accounts require account context and region confirmation.

## When to engage this Power

Activate when the task references Contabo services, resources, or operations. Do not activate on unrelated requests - narrow keyword matching is required to avoid false activations (Kiro Powers convention).

## Routing pattern

- **`techtide-contabo-maestro-agent`** - classifies and routes the task to the right specialist

Use the maestro as the entry point: classify the task, then dispatch to one specialist or a parallel team of specialists. Never have the maestro itself execute a live mutation.

## Live-guard agents (gate_mode only)

- `techtide-contabo-live-instance-lifecycle-guard-agent` - never auto-dispatched; gate_mode only
- `techtide-contabo-live-storage-operations-guard-agent` - never auto-dispatched; gate_mode only

Live-guard agents enforce approval, target confirmation, evidence capture, and rollback plans before executing a mutation. They are never auto-dispatched - the maestro must place them in `live-guard-gate` or `runtime-evidence-gate` mode.

## Invariants

- Confirm Contabo account context and region before any live mutation.
- Live-guard agents (contabo-live-*) must never be auto-dispatched; require approval and rollback plan.
- Storage operations on object storage and block storage require backup verification before destructive actions.

## Where the agents live

Agent specs and adapters are part of the [TechTide Harness Kit](https://github.com/TechTideOhio/techtide-harness-kit) marketplace. For this provider, see `agents/contabo/` in that repository. All 6 agents in this provider ship a Kiro adapter (`harnesses/kiro-ide.agent.md`, `kiro-cli.agent.json`).

## Companion install paths

- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add TechTideOhio/techtide-harness-kit` then `/plugin install techtide-harness-kit@techtide-harness-kit`
- **Codex / Copilot / Cursor / Gemini CLI / Kiro (file export):** `npx thk-export-agents --platform <harness> --provider contabo --repo .`
