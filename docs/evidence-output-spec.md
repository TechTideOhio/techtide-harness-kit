# Evidence Output Specification

> Canonical response shape for all TFA live-guard and review agents, and its mapping to compliance framework controls.

## Purpose

Every live-guard and review agent in this repo produces a **structured verdict response**. This document defines the required fields and maps each field to common compliance-control evidence needs, so the response can support audit and engineering review without pretending to replace auditor judgment.

The five fields below are the minimum set required on every agent response. Agents may add provider-specific fields (e.g., `cluster_context`, `assignment_scope`) but must not omit required fields.

---

## Required Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `verdict` | `approved` \| `blocked` \| `needs-review` | Binary gate decision. |
| `evidence_level` | `verified` \| `partial` \| `assumed` | Confidence in the captured baseline. `verified` = live state confirmed via CLI read; `partial` = snapshot exists but may be stale; `assumed` = no current-state capture possible. |
| `blockers` | `string[]` | Each item is a named violation that must be resolved before the change is approved. Empty array if verdict is `approved`. |
| `safe_next_actions` | `string[]` | Ordered remediation steps if blocked, or post-approval verification steps if approved. |
| `open_questions` | `string[]` | Ambiguities requiring human clarification. May be empty. |

### Example - Blocked Response

```json
{
  "verdict": "blocked",
  "evidence_level": "verified",
  "blockers": [
    "verb 'escalate' present - requires platform-team sign-off",
    "wildcard resource '*' on ClusterRole - never approved without CISO justification"
  ],
  "safe_next_actions": [
    "Remove 'escalate' verb; request platform-team approval if needed",
    "Replace '*' resource with explicit list: ['pods', 'services', 'configmaps']",
    "Re-submit for review after scoping changes"
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Is this ClusterRole intended to be namespace-scoped? If so, use a Role instead."
  ]
}
```

### Example - Approved Response

```json
{
  "verdict": "approved",
  "evidence_level": "verified",
  "blockers": [],
  "safe_next_actions": [
    "kubectl apply -f role.yaml",
    "kubectl auth can-i list pods --as system:serviceaccount:default:my-sa -n production",
    "Confirm binding propagated: kubectl get rolebinding my-binding -n production"
  ],
  "open_questions": []
}
```

## Compliance Framework Mapping

The table below maps each response field to compliance controls it can support. A single structured response from a live-guard or review agent is an evidence-supporting artifact; regulated teams should retain approvals, tickets, logs, and auditor-requested documentation alongside it.

| Response Field | SOC 2 (CC) | PCI DSS v4 | NIS 2 (Article) | NIST CSF (PR) | ISO 27001 (A.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `verdict` | CC6.1 - logical access controls | Req 7.2 - access control systems | Art. 21(2)(e) - access control | PR.AC-4 - access permissions managed | A.9.1.1 - access control policy |
| `evidence_level` | CC7.2 - monitoring activities | Req 10.2 - audit log completeness | Art. 21(2)(b) - incident handling | PR.IP-1 - baseline configuration | A.12.4.1 - event logging |
| `blockers` | CC6.3 - removal of access | Req 7.3 - least privilege enforcement | Art. 21(2)(i) - supply chain security | PR.AC-6 - identities proofed | A.9.2.3 - privileged access rights |
| `safe_next_actions` | CC8.1 - change management | Req 6.5 - secure development | Art. 21(2)(f) - security procedures | PR.IP-3 - configuration change control | A.12.1.2 - change management |
| `open_questions` | CC4.1 - COSO monitoring | Req 12.3 - targeted risk analysis | Art. 21(1) - risk management | ID.RA-3 - threats identified | A.6.1.2 - segregation of duties |

### How This Creates Audit Evidence

A reviewer or auditor can:

1. Export the structured response as a JSON artifact at change time.
2. Hash the artifact and store it alongside the change record (Git commit, JIRA ticket, ServiceNow change).
3. Reference the artifact in a SOC 2 or PCI DSS audit by mapping `verdict=approved` + `evidence_level=verified` + empty `blockers` to the controls in the table above.

This eliminates manual evidence collection for the five most common cloud access-control audit questions:
- "Did you review permissions before granting access?" → `verdict` field + agent name
- "Did you capture the baseline before mutating?" → `evidence_level: verified`
- "Were escalation paths blocked?" → `blockers` field
- "What was the approved remediation path?" → `safe_next_actions`
- "Were ambiguities escalated for human review?" → `open_questions`

## Three Enforcement Layers

TFA agents cover three layers of every critical decision point. The evidence output spec applies to all three:

| Layer | Agent Type | Timing | Compliance Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BEFORE** | Review agents (e.g., `techtide-kubernetes-rbac-review`) | Pre-change, during design | SOC2 CC6.1 design evidence |
| **AT** | Live-guard agents (e.g., `techtide-kubernetes-live-rbac-mutation-guard`) | At execution, blocking | NIST CSF PR.AC-4 enforcement control |
| **AFTER** | Verification agents (e.g., `kubectl auth can-i` in safe_next_actions) | Post-change, audit trail | ISO 27001 A.12.4.1 event logging |

---

## Five Critical Decision Points

The live-guard agents cover the five decision points where unguarded automation creates the highest Fortune 50 compliance risk:

| Decision Point | Provider Coverage | Primary Control |
|---|---|---|
| IAM/RBAC change | AWS IAM, Azure Entra ID, OCI IAM, Kubernetes RBAC | SOC2 CC6.1, PCI Req 7 |
| Network exposure | AWS Security Groups, Azure NSGs, OCI Security Lists/NSGs | NIST CSF PR.AC-4 |
| Production deployment | AWS ECS/Lambda, Azure App Service/AKS, OCI OKE | SOC2 CC8.1, PCI Req 6.5 |
| Secret/key lifecycle | AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, OCI Vault | ISO 27001 A.9.2.3 |
| Permanent privilege escalation | Azure PIM, OCI Resource Manager, Kubernetes escalate/bind | NIS2 Art. 21(2)(e) |

---

## Extending This Spec

To add a new compliance framework (e.g., FedRAMP, HIPAA, CIS Controls):

1. Add a column to the framework mapping table above.
2. Map each response field to the most specific control in the new framework.
3. Add a row to the Five Critical Decision Points table if the new framework introduces a sixth decision point not already covered.
4. Do not add framework columns without concrete control references - `assumed` mappings create audit risk.
